i have a bad feeling about this
its not about the mission master its
master yoda says i should be mindful of the future
yes masterhow do you think the trade viceroy will deal with
offhand id say this mission is past the negotiaion stage
they have shield generators
its an invisible army
you were right about one thing master the negotiations were
sorry master the water fried my weapon
yes master
whats this
when they find us they will crush us grind us into little
dont worry this has not been our day for warm welcomes
after those droids take control of the surface they will come
you and the naboo form a symbiont circle what happens to noe of
master whats a bongo
we are short of time master
master why do you keep dragging these pathetic life forms along
why were you banished jar jar
they banished you because youre clumsy

sorry quigons right youll make things less obvious
cantd the hyperdrive generator is gone we will need a new
i fell it also master
vo a few containers of supplies the queens wardrobe maybe
this storms going to slow them down
its a trick send no reply send no transmission of any kind
the queen is upsetbut absolutly no reply was sent
what if it is true and the people are dying
what if this plan fails master we could be stuck here for a
yes master
wait a minute
all right ive got it
something must be wrong with the transmission
strange the transmission seems to be in good order but the
even master yoda doesnt have a midichlorian count that high
what does it mean
why do i sense weve picked up another pathetic life form
over there fly low
what was it
the boy will not pass the councils tests master and you know

possibly
you look tired
because of your mother
dreams pass in time
mind your thoughts anakin theybetray you youve made acommitment to the jedi order acommitment not easily brokenand dont forget shes apolitician theyre not to betrusted
its been my experience thatsenators are only focused onpleasing those who fund theircampaigns and they are morethan willing to forget theniceties of democracy to get thosefunds
palpatines a politician iveobserved that he is very clever atfollowing the passions andprejudices of the senators
i sense it too
i have a bad feeling about this
what took you so long
if youd spend as much timeworking on your saber skills asyou do on your wit young padawanyou would rival master yoda as aswordsman

wouldnt that be on record
thats impossible perhaps thearchives are incomplete
i am sorry to disturb you master
im looking for a planet describedto me by an old friend i trusthim but the system doesnt showup on the archive maps
this is where it ought to bebut it isnt gravity is pullingall the stars in this area inwardto this spot there should be astar here but there isnt
but master yoda who could haveerased information from thearchives thats impossibleisnt it
i am concerned for my padawan heis not ready to be on his own
but he still has much to learnand his abilities have made himwell arrogant i realise nowwhat you and master yoda knew fromthe beginning the boy was tooold to start the training and
master he should not have beengiven this assignment im afraidanakin wont be able to protectthe senator
he has a an emotionalconnection with her its beenthere since he was boy nowhes confused distracted
has master yoda gained any insightinto whether or not this war willcome about
warilyim expected

i was beginning to wonder if youhad gotten my message

hold on look over there
no forget her we have to goafter dooku

anakin no
i dont think so
you will have to prove it
anakin
on his way back to naboo he isescorting senator amidala home
continuingi must admit without the clonesit would not have been a victory
look out four droids inbound
weve got to split them up
easy for you to say why am i always the bait
anakin theyre all over me
im going down on the deck
hurry up i dont like this
continuing ouch
continuing dont even try to fix it arfour ive shut it down
next time youre the bait now lets find the command ship and get on with it
i see it oh this is going to be easy
not this time theres too much at stake we need help odd ball do you copy
mark my position and form your squad up behind me
add five trifighters on the right
take it easy anakin
five more on the right
im going high and right
stay with me swing back and right help me engage back off let them pass between us
all right engage and hurry these droids are all over me like a rash
anakin you have four on your tail
four more closing from your left
break right and go high
to himself he still has much to learn
too dangerous first jedi rule
just keep me steady hold on not yet now break left
continuing youll never get through there anakin its too tight
use the force think yourself through the ship will follow
no no they are doing their job so we can do ours head for the command ship
they overshot us
all right arfour no no nothing too fancy
flying is for droids
continuing im hit anakin
arfour be careful you have one
oh dear theyre shutting down all the controls
the mission get to the command ship get the chancellor im running out of tricks here
continuing in the name of
anakin hold your fire hold your fire youre not helping here
wait wait i cant see a thing my cockpits fogging theyre all over me anakin
hold on anakin youre going to get us both killed get out of here theres nothing more you can do
blast it i cant see my controls are gone
artoo hit the buzz droids center eye
great artoo
have you noticed the shields are still up
oh i have a bad feeling about this
artoo locate the chancellor
the chancellors signal is coming from right there the observation platform at the top of that spire
i sense a trap
spring the trap
here take this and wait for orders
we are here to relieve you of chancellor palpatine not join him
anakin
fuel the slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion thats why theyve stopped shooting
your idea of safe is not the same as mine
six droids coming our way
well never get through that its too small
anakin this is no time for jokes were in serious trouble here
that wont hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers
you still have much to learn anakin
all right you win i have much to learn lets go
did you press the stop button
no
we dont want to get out we want to get moving artoo artoo do you copy activate elevator looks at control panel
artoo
continuing always on the move
os artoo switch on the comlink artoo do you hear me artoo we gave you a job to do artoo
stop stop artoo we need to be going up
os artoo do you copy artoo do you hear me artoo we need to be going up not down
stop artoo we need to go up stop stop
now thats better
oh its you
well artoo has been
did i say anything
i didnt say anything
bows chancellor
quietly to anakin this time we will do it together
chancellor palpatine sith lords are our specialty
you wont get away this time dooku
did i miss something
what is that
continuing oops
too late jump
lets see if we can find something in the hangar bay thats still flyable come on
none of those ships will get us anywhere
dont look at me i dont know
well head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod
wait a minute howd this happen were smarter than this
oh so all of a sudden its my fault
im open to suggestions here
patience thats your plan is it
do you have a plan b
that depends upon your point of view hah
anakin try not to upset him we have a job to do
not this time and this time you wont escape
grievous can you fly a cruiser like this
well
steady attitude eighteen degrees
temp steady hatches open flaps extended drag fins
not to worry were still flying half the ship
careful were heating uptwelve thousand thirteen thousand
eight plus sixtyforty eight plus sixtytwenty eight plus sixty temp ten thousand nine thousand were in the atmosphere
steady steady
five thousand three thousand two thousand fireships on the left and the right
copy that landing strips straight ahead
easyeasy
another happy landing
oh no im not brave enough for politics i have to report to the council besides someone needs to be the poster boy
sorry old friend let us not forget that you rescued me from the buzz droids and you killed count dooku and you rescued the chancellor carrying me unconscious on your back and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely
the endless speeches anakin lets be fair today you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians
ninth time that business on cato nemoidia doesnt count ill see you at the briefing
you missed the report on the outer rim sieges
in short they are going very well saleucami has fallen and master vos has moved his troops to boz pity
the senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the chancellor today
anakin be careful of your friend palpatine
he has requested your presence
he would not say
all of this is unusual and its making me feel uneasy youre probably aware that relations between the council and the chancellor are stressed
the force grows dark anakin and we are all affected by it be wary of your feelings
it may take some time we do not have many ships to spare
and yet it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup
hes right that is a system we cannot afford to lose its the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant
calm down anakin you have been given a great honor to be on the council at your age its never happened before listen to me anakin the fact of the matter is youre too close to the chancellor the council doesnt like it when he interferes in jedi affairs
but its what you wanted your friendship with chancellor palpatine seems to have paid off
anakin regardless of how it happened you find yourself in a delicate situation
i warned you there was tension between the council and the chancellor i was very clear why didnt you listen you walked right into it
no it is not anakin i worry when you speak of jealousy and pride those are not jedi thoughts theyre dangerous dark thoughts
i hope so
anakin the only reason the council has approved your appointment is because the chancellor trusts you
anakin look i am on your side i didnt want to see you put in this situation
takes a deep breath the council wants you to report on all of the chancellors dealings they want to know what hes up to
we are at war anakin the jedi council is sworn to uphold the principles of the republic even if the chancellor does not
this assignment is not to be on record the council asked me to approach you on this personally
that is why you must help us anakin our allegiance is to the senate not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired
yes but use your feelings anakin something is out of place
the council is asking you
anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm
hell be all right i trust him with my life
with all due respect master is he not the chosen one is he not to destroy the sith and bring balance to the force
he will not let me down he never has
does everyone agree
oh no youre quite right but i do have the most experience with his ways of combat
has anakin been to see you
i know he deserves it he is impatient strong willed very opinionated but truly gifted
you should be a jedi padme
its anakin hes becoming moody and detached hes been put in a difficult position as the chancellors representative but i think its more than that i was hoping he may have talked to you
neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either
i know how he feels about you
nothing he didnt have to
i know you both too well i can see you two are in love padme im worried about him
continuing i fear your relationship has confused him hes changed considerably since we returned
continuing padme im not telling the council about any of this i i hope i didnt upset you were all friends i care about both of you
please do what you can to help him
oh i agree however it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase
you are strong and wise anakin and i am very proud of you i have trained you since you were a small boy i have taught you everything i know and you have become a far greater jedi than i could ever hope to be and you have saved my life more times than i can remember but be patient anakin it wont be long before the council makes you a jedi master
continuing dont worry i have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of utapau i think ill be able to handle the situation even without your help
goodbye old friend may the force be with you
ill keep them distracted until you get there just dont take too long
laughing cato nemoidia for starters
very well the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there
save your energy
dont give up padme dont give up
unfortunately the war
with your kind permission i should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as i search nearby systems for general grievous
i understand
tell your people to take shelter if you have warriors now is the time
continuing geenine take the fighter back to the ship im staying here tell cody ive made contact
i need transportation
get it for me
this one
good girl boga
hello there
your move
you forget i trained the jedi that defeated count dooku
i may not defeat your droids but my troops certainly will
i dont think so
so uncivilized
commander contact your troops tell them to move to the higher levels
thank you cody smiling now lets get a move on weve got a battle to win here
emergency code nine thirteen i have no contact on any frequency are there any jedi out there anywhere
continuing ive locked on repeat
senator organa my clone troops turned on me i need help
you were attacked by your clones also
how many other jedi managed to survive
have we had any contact from the temple
well then we must go back if there are other stragglers they will fall into the trap and be killed
yes master there is too much at stake here and we need a clearer picture of what has happened
no i dont think so the chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the senate intact
it would be better if we stayed with the senator
there are several battalions of clone troopers on every level many are dressed as jedi
not even the younglings survived
who who could have done this
ive recalibrated the code warning all surviving jedi to stay away
wait master there is something i must know
i must know the truth master
continuing it cant be it cant be
i cant watch any more
send me to kill the emperor i will not kill anakin
he is like my brother i cannot do it
how could it have come to this
i do not know where the emperor has sent him i dont know where to look
may the force be with you master yoda
has anakin been here
the republic has fallen padme the jedi order is no more
i believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the making
no padme its over the sith now rule the galaxy as they did before the republic
im here looking for anakin when was the last time you saw him
and do you know where he is now
padme i need your help hes in grave danger
from himself padme anakin has turned to the dark side
i have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings
he was deceived by a lie we all were it appears that the chancellor is behind everything including the war palpatine is the sith lord weve been looking for after the death of count dooku anakin became his new apprentice
padme i must find him
he has become a very great threat
anakin is the father isnt he
continuing im so sorry
let her go anakin
let her go
you have done that yourself
your anger and your lust for power have already done that
continuing you have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind until now until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy
your new empire
anakin my allegiance is to the republic to democracy
only a sith lord deals in absolutes i will do what i must
ive heard that before anakin but i never thought id hear it from you
continuing the flaw of power is arrogance
i have failed you anakin i was never able to teach you to think
from the sith anakin chancellor palpatine is evil
well then you are lost
its over anakin i have the high ground
dont try it
continuing you were the chosen one it was said that you would destroy the sith not join them it was you who would bring balance to the force not leave it in darkness
you were my brother anakin i loved you
shes dying
dont give up padme
you have twins padme they need you hang on
save your energy
we must take them somewhere the sith will not sense their presence
and what of the boy
i will take the child and watch over him master yoda do you think anakins twins will be able to defeat darth sidious
training
who
quigon but how could he accomplish this
i will be able to talk with him
hello there come here my little friend dont be afraid
dont worry hell be all right
rest easy son youve had a busy day youre fortunate youre still in one piece
the jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly tell me young luke what brings you out this far
obiwan kenobi obiwan now thats a name i havent heard in a long time a long time
oh hes not dead no not yet
well of course of course i know him hes me i havent gone by the name obiwan since oh before you were born
dont seem to remember ever owning a droid very interesting
i think we better get indoors the sand people are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers
quickly son theyre on the move
thats what your uncle told you he didnt hold with your fathers ideals thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved
yes i was once a jedi knight the same as your father
he was the best starpilot in the galaxy and a cunning warrior i understand youve become quite a good pilot yourself and he was a good friend which reminds me
i have something here for you your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough but your uncle wouldnt allow it he feared you might follow old obiwan on some damnedfool idealistic crusade like your father did
your fathers lightsaber this is the weapon of a jedi knight not as clumsy or as random as a blaster
an elegant weapon for a morecivilized time for over a thousand generations the jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old republic before the dark times before the empire
a young jedi named darth vader who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil helped the empire hunt down and destroy the jedi knights he betrayed and murdered your father now the jedi are all but extinct vader was seduced by the dark side of the force
well the force is what gives the jedi his power its an energy field created by all living things it surrounds us and penetrates us it binds the galaxy together
now lets see if we cant figure out what you are my little friend and where you come from
i seem to have found it
you must learn the ways of the force if youre to come with me to alderaan
i need your help luke im getting too old for this sort of thingshe needs your help
thats your uncle talking
learn about the force luke
you must do what you feel is right of course
they didnt but we are meant to think they did these tracks are side by side sand people always ride single file to hide there numbers
and these blast points too accurate for sand people only imperial stormtroopers are so precise
wait luke its too dangerous
theres nothing you could have done luke had you been there youd have been killed too and the droids would now be in the hands of the empire
mos eisley spaceport you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy we must be cautious
theyre for sale if you want them
you dont need to see his identification
looking for
he can go about his business
move along
the force can have a strong influence on the weakminded you will find it a powerful ally
well most of the best freighter pilots can be found here only watch your step this place can be a little rough
this little one isnt worth the effort come let me buy you something
this is chewbacca hes firstmate on a ship that might suit our needs
yes indeed if its a fast ship
should i have
only passengers myself the boy two droids and no questions asked
lets just say wed like to avoid any imperial entanglements
we havent that much with us but we could pay you two thousand now plus fifteen when we reach alderaan
ninetyfour
youll have to sell your speeder
it will be enough
if the ships as fast as hes boasting we ought to do well
how long before you can make the jump to light speed
i felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced i fear something terrible has happened
youd better get on with your exercises
remember a jedi can feel the force flowing through him
partially but it also obeys your commands
i suggest you try it again luke
this time let go your conscious self and act on instinct
your eyes can deceive you dont trust them
stretch out with your feelings
you see you can do it
in my experience theres no such thing as luck
thats good you have taken your first step into a larger world
destroyed by the empire
its an imperial fighter
no its a short range fighter
itd be as well to let it go its too far out of range
a fighter that size couldnt get this deep into space on its own
thats no moon its a space station
turn the ship around
you cant win but there are alternatives to fighting
leave that to me
whos the more foolish the fool or the fool who follows him
plug in he should be able to interpret the entire imperial computer network
i dont think you boys can help i must go alone
be patient luke stay and watch over the droids
they must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as alderaan your destiny lies along a different path from mine the force will be with you always
only a master of evil darth
you cant win darth if you strike me down i shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine
run luke run
luke the force will be with you
use the force luke
let go luke
luke trust me
remember the force will be with you always
lukeluke
you will go to the dagobah system
there you will learn from yoda the jedi master who instructed me
he will learn patience
was i any different when you taught me
so was i if youll remember
you dont know that
even yoda cannot see their fate
but you cannot control it this is a dangerous time for you when you will be tempted by the dark side of the force
it is you and your abilities the emperor wants that is why your friends are made to suffer
luke i dont want to lose you to the emperor the way i lost vader
patience
if you choose to face vader you will do it alone i cannot interfere
luke dont give in to hate that leads to the dark side
that boy is our last hope
yoda will always be with you
you father was seduced by the dark side of the force he ceased to be anakin skywalker and became darth vader when that happened the good man who was your father was destroyed so what i have told you was true from a certain point of view
luke youre going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view
i dont blame you for being angry if i was wrong in what i did it certainly wouldnt have been for the first time you see what happened to your father was my fault
anakin was a good friend
when i first knew him your father was already a great pilot but i was amazed how strongly the force was with him i took it upon myself to train him as a jedi i thought that i could instruct him just as well as yoda i was wrong my pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy
i also thought he could be turned back to the good side it couldnt be done he is more machine now than man twisted and evil
you cannot escape your destiny
vader humbled you when first you met him lukebut that experience was part of your training it taught you among other things the value of patience had you not been so impatient to defeat vader then you could have finished your training here with yoda you would have been prepared
and did you help them it was they who had to save you you achieved little by rushing back prematurely i fear
to be a jedi luke you must confront and then go beyond the dark side the side your father couldnt get past impatience is the easiest door for you like your father only your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door and you have held firm youre no longer so reckless now luke you are strong and patient and now you must face darth vader again
then the emperor has already won you were our only hope
the other he spoke of is your twin sister
hmm to protect you both from the emperor you were hidden from your father when you were born the emperor knew as i did if anakin were to have any offspring they would be a threat to him that is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous
your insight serves you well bury your feelings deep down luke they do you credit but they could be made to serve the emperor
when your father left he didnt know your mother was pregnant your mother and i knew he would find out eventually but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible for as long as possible so i took you to live with my brother owen on tatooine and your mother took leia to live as the daughter of senator organa on alderaan
the organa household was highborn and politically quite powerful in that system leia became a princess by virtue of lineage no one knew shed been adopted of course but it was a title without real power since alderaan had long been a democracy even so the family continued to be politically powerful and leia following in her foster fathers path became a senator as well thats not all she became of course she became the leader of her cell in the alliance against the corrupt empire and because she had diplomatic immunity she was a vital link for getting information to the rebel cause thats what she was doing when her path crossed yours for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on tatooine if her troubles became desperate
she hasnt been trained in the ways of the jedi the way you have luke but the force is strong with her as it is with all of your family there is no avoiding the battle you must face and destroy vader
