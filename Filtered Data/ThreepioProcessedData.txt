master kenobi we have miss padme on board please please hurry we should leave this dreadful place
it s some kind of reproductive process i think
oh no
did you hear that theyve shut down the main reactor well be destroyed for sure this is madness
were doomed
therell be no escape for the princess this time
whats that
i should have known better than to trust the logic of a halfsized thermocapsulary dehousing assister
artoo artoodetoo where are you
at last where have you been
theyre heading in this direction what are we going to do well be sent to the spice mines of kessel or smashed into who knows what
wait a minute where are you going
hey youre not permitted in there its restricted youll be deactivated for sure
dont call me a mindless philosopher you overweight glob of grease now come out before somebody sees you
secret mission what plans what are you talking about im not getting in there
im going to regret this
thats funny the damage doesnt look as bad from out here
are you sure this things safe
how did i get into this mess i really dont know how we seem to be made to suffer its our lot in life
ive got to rest before i fall apart my joints are almost frozen
what a desolate place this is
where are you going
well im not going that way its much too rocky this way is much easier
what makes you think there are settlements over there
dont get technical with me
what mission what are you talking about ive had just about enough of you go that way youll be malfunctioning within a day you nearsighted scrap pile
and dont let me catch you following me begging for help because you wont get it
no more adventures im not going that way
that malfunctioning little twerp this is all his fault he tricked me into going this way but hell do no better
wait whats that a transport im saved
over here help please help
artoodetoo its you its you
wake up wake up
were doomed
do you think theyll melt us down
dont shoot dont shoot will this never end
sir not in an environment such as this thats why ive also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that
vaporators sir my first job was programming binary load lifters very similar to your vaporators you could say
of course i can sir its like a second language for me im as fluent in bocce
shutting up sir
excuse me sir but that r unit is in prime condition a real bargain
uh im quite sure youll be very pleased with that one sir he really is in firstclass condition ive worked with him before here he comes
now dont forget this why i should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity
thank the maker this oil bath is going to feel so good ive got such a bad case of dust contamination i can barely move
is there anything i might do to help
i dont think so sir im only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things not on this planet anyways as a matter of fact im not even sure which planet im on
i see sir
i see sir luke
and i am seethreepio humancyborg relations and this is my counterpart artoodetoo
with all weve been through sometimes im amazed were in as good condition as we are what with the rebellion and all
thats how we came to be in your service if you take my meaning sir
several i think actually theres not much to tell im not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories well not at making them interesting anyways
what is what he asked you a questionwhat is that
oh he says its nothing sir merely a malfunction old data pay it no mind
im afraid im not quite sure sir
i think she was a passenger on our last voyage a person of some importance sir i believe our captain was attached to
behave yourself artoo youre going to get us in trouble its all right you can trust him hes our new master
he says hes the property of obiwan kenobi a resident of these parts and its a private message for him quite frankly sir i dont know what hes talking about our last master was captain antilles but with what weve been through this little r unit has become a bit eccentric
i beg your pardon sir but do you know what hes talking about
he says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system he suggests that if you remove the bolt he might be able to play back the entire recording
been playing the one youre carrying inside your rusty innards
im sorry sir but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter
just you reconsider playing that message for him
no i dont think he likes you at all
no i dont like you either
it wasnt my fault sir please dont deactivate me i told him not to go but hes faulty malfunctioning kept babbling on about his mission
that r unit has always been a problem these astrodroids are getting quite out of hand even i cant understand their logic at times
pardon me sir but couldnt we go after him
oh he excels at that sir
sir would it help if you told him it was my fault
deactivate well on the other hand if you hadnt removed his restraining bolt
master luke here is your rightful owner well have no more of this obiwan kenobi jibberish and dont talk to me of your mission either youre fortunate he doesnt blast you into a million pieces right here
if you dont mind my saying so sir i think you should deactivate the little fugitive until youve gotten him back to your workshop
oh my sir he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast
where am i i must have taken a bad step
i dont think i can make it you go on master luke theres no sense in you risking yourself on my account im done for
sir if youll not be needing me ill close down for awhile
i cant abide these jawas disgusting creatures
come along artoo
i heartily agree with you sir
i dont like the look of this
lock the door artoo
i would much rather have gone with master luke than stay here with you i dont know what all this trouble is about but im sure it must be your fault
you watch your language
hello sir
oh my id forgotten how much i hate space travel
now be careful artoo
he made a fair move screaming about it wont help you
but sir nobody worries about upsetting a droid
i see your point sir i suggest a new strategy artoo let the wookiee win
we found the computer outlet sir
he says hes found the main control to the power beam thats holding the ship here hell try to make the precise location appear on the monitor
the tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations a power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave
im afraid im not quite sure sir he says i found her and keepsrepeating shes here
princess leia
level five detention block aatwentythree im afraid shes scheduled to be terminated
master luke sir pardon me for asking but ah what should artoo and i do if were discovered here
that isnt very reassuring
yes sir
i said all systems have been alerted to your presence sir the main entrance seems to be the only way out all other information on your level is restricted
oh no
theyre madmen theyre heading for the prison level if you hurry you might catch them
come on
oh all this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here if you dont mind id like to take him down to maintenance
they arent here something must have happened to them see if theyve been captured
hurry
thank goodness they havent found them where could they be
use the comlink oh my i forgot i turned it off
are you there sir
weve had some problems
no shut them all down hurry
listen to them theyre dying artoo curse my metal body i wasnt fast enough its all my fault my poor master
for the moment uh were in the main hangar across from the ship
where could they be
come on artoo were going
oooh
help i think im meltingthis is all your fault
hang on tight artoo youve got to come back
you wouldnt want my life to get boring would you
hang on artoo
oh my artoo can you hear me say somethingyou can repair him cant you
you must repair him sir if any of my circuits or gears will help ill gladly donate them
dont try to blame me i didnt ask you to turn on the thermal heater i merely commented that it was freezing in the princesss chamber but its supposed to be freezing how are we going to dry out all her clothes i really dont know
oh switch off
excuse me sir
might i have a word with you please
well its princess leia sir shes been trying to get you on the communicator
oh well princess leia is wondering about master luke he hasnt come back yet she doesnt know where he is
nobody knows where he is
well uh you see
excuse me sir might i inqu
excuse me sir might i inquire whats going on
impossible man come along artoo lets find princess leia between ourselves i think master luke is in considerable danger
you must come along now artoo theres really nothing more we can do and my joints are freezing up
dont say thing like that of course well see master luke again hell be quite all right youll see stupid little shortcircuit hell be quite all right
mistress leia artoo says hes been quite unable to pick up any signals although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope
artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventyfiveto one
actually artoo has been known to make mistakesfrom time to time oh dear oh dear dont worry about master luke im sure hell be all right hes quite clever you knowfor a human being
master luke sir its good to see you fully functional again
artoo expresses his relief also
excuse us please
sir i am fluent in six million forms of communication this signal is not used by the alliance it could be an imperial code
artoo you take good care of master luke now understand anddo take care of yourself oh dear oh dear
your highness we must take this last transport its our only hope
oh wait for me
butbutbutwhere are you going uhcome back
wait wait for me wait stop
how typical
wait wait
captain solo captain solosir might i suggest that you
it can wait
sir sir might i suggest
but sir
if i may say so sir i noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged its impossible to go to lightspeed
sir the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand seven hundred and twenty to one
pulverized
closer
oh this is suicide
excuse me maam but where are we going
sir im almost afraid to ask butdoes that include shutting me down too
sir its quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable
oh sometimes i just dont understand human behavior after all im only trying to do my job in the most
oh where is artoo when i need him
sir i dont know where your ship learned to communicate but it has the most peculiar dialect i believe sir it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized im afraid youll have to replace it
sir sir ive isolated the reverse power flux coupling
oh youre perfectly welcome sir
sir if i may venture an opinion
there it is listen listen
i think it might be better if i stay here and guard the ship oh no
ohhh go away go away beastly thing shoo shoo
look
were doomed
oh thank goodness were coming out of the asteroid field
sir we just lost the main rear deflector shield one more direct hit on the back quarter and were done for
sir the odds of surviving a direct assault on an imperial star destroyer
captain solo this time you have gone too far no i will not be quiet chewbacca why doesnt anyone listen to me
i really dont see how thats going to help surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances the empire may be gracious enough
rather touchy arent they
oh no one to meet us
well they did let us land
well he seems very friendly
hello sir i am seethreepio humancyborg relations my facilities are at your
well really
oh nice to see a familiar face
how rude
that sounds like an r unit in there i wonder if
hello how interesting oh my
oh im terribly sorry ii didnt mean to intrude no no please dont get up no
mmmm oh my uh i uh take this off i uh dont mean to intrude here i dont no no noplease dont get up no
stormtroopers here were in danger i must tell the others oh no ive been shot
oh yes thats very good i like that oh somethings not right because now i cant see wait wait oh my what have you done im backwards you stupid furball only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough
if only you had attached my legs i wouldnt be in this ridiculous position now remember chewbacca you have a responsibility to me so dont do anything foolish
oh no no no no stop chewbacca stop
yes stop please im not ready to die
whatwhats going on turn around chewbacca i cant see ohtheyve encased him in carbonite he should be quite wellprotected if he survives the freezing process that is
i knew all along it had to be a mistake
what are you doing trust him trust him
it sounds like han
im terribly sorry about all this after all hes only a wookiee
artoo artoo where have you been
turn around you wooly hurry hurry were trying to save han from the bounty hunter
well at least your still in one piece look what happened to me
oh no chewie theyre behind you
artoo you can tell the computer to override the security system
dont blame me im an interpreter im not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal
what are you talking about were not interested in the hyperdrive on the millennium falcon its fixed just open the door you stupid lump
i never doubted you for a second wonderful
ouch oh ah that hurt bend down you thoughtlessow
i thought that hairy beast would be the end of me of course ive looked better
noisy brute why dont we just go into lightspeed
we cant how would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated
the citys central computer told you artoodetoo you know better than to trust a strange computer ouch pay attention to what youre doing
artoo come back at once you havent finished with me yet you dont know how to fix the hyperdrive chewbacca can do it im standing here in pieces and youre having delusions of grandeur
oh you did it
of course im worried and you should be too lando calrissian and poor chewbacca never returned from this awful place
dont be so sure if i told you half the things ive heard about this jabba the hutt youd probably shortcircuit
artoo are you sure this is the right place i better knock i suppose
there doesnt seem to be anyone there lets go back and tell master luke
goodness gracious me
artoo detoowha bo seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka jabba du hutt
i dont think theyre going to let us in artoo wed better go
artoo wait oh dear artoo artoo i really dont think we should rush into all this
oh artoo artoo wait for me
just you deliver master lukes message and get us out of here oh my oh oh no
oh my die wanna wauaga we we bring a message to your master jabba the hutt
and a gift gift what gift
he says that our instructions are to give it only to jabba himself
im terribly sorry im afraid hes ever so stubborn about these sort of things
artoo i have a bad feeling about this
good morning
the message artoo the message
what did he say
this cant be artoo youre playing the wrong message
were doomed
artoo look captain solo and hes still frozen in carbonite
what could possibly have come over master luke is it something i did he never expressed any unhappiness with my work oh oh hold it ohh
i am seethreepio humancy
oh well yes
i am fluent in over six million forms of communication and can readily
disintegrated
artoo dont leave me ohhh
oh no chewbacca
oh uh yes uh i am here your worshipfulness uh yes
oh the illustrious jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty five thousand
uh oh but what what did i say uh the mighty jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand
because hes holding a thermal detonator
jabba offers the sum of thirtyfive and i suggest you take it
he agrees
ohhh i cant bear to watch
at last master lukes come to rescue me
master luke youre standing on
oh no the rancor
oh dear his high exaltedness the great jabba the hutt has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately
you will therefore be taken to the dune sea and cast into the pit of carkoon the nesting place of the allpowerful sarlacc
in his belly you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years
oh im terribly sor artoo what are you doing here
well i can see youre serving drinks but this place is dangerous theyre going to execute master luke and if were not careful us too
hmm i wish i had your confidence
victims of the almighty sarlacc his excellency hopes that you will die honorably but should any of you wish to beg for mercy the great jabba the hutt will now listen to your pleas
not my eyes artoo help quickly artoo oh ohhh you beast
artoo where are we going i couldnt possibly jump
sounds dangerous
exciting is hardly the word i would use
here we go again
oh i told you it was dangerous here
oh general solo somebodys coming oh
dont worry master luke we know what to do
and you said it was pretty here ugh
oh master luke
im afraid that artoos sensors can find no trace of princess leia
artoo im not sure thats such a good idea its a very long drooop
oh my head oh my goodness
oh yes master luke remember that i am fluent in over six million forms of communication
hello i think i could be mistaken theyre using a very primitive dialect but i do believe they think i am some sort of god
i beg your pardon general solo but that just wouldnt be proper
its against my programming to impersonate a deity
im rather embarrassed general solo but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor
your royal highness
but master luke what magic couldnt possibly
you see master luke they didnt believe me just
as i said they wouldnt whawhawhats happening oh oh dear oh
put me down heeelp master luke artoo somebody somebody help master luke artoo artoo quickly do something somebody oh ohhh
oh oh oh oh thank goodness
ii never knew i had it in me
yes artoo i was just coming to that
wonderful we are now a part of the tribe
he says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator
he says theres a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge
oh oh my uh princess leia
im afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash
i have decided that we shall stay here
oh my theyll be captured
wawait wait come back artoo stay with me
hello i say over there were you looking for me
