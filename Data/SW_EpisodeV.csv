character,dialogue
HAN,"Loud and clear, kid. What's up?"
HAN,There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a  space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back.
HAN,Chewie!
HAN,"All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give  you a hand."
HAN,"No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.  You'll know if anything comes around."
HAN,No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.
HAN,"General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore."
HAN,"Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the  Hut, I'm a dead man."
HAN,"Thank you, General."
HAN,"Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it."
LEIA,That's right.
HAN,"Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess."
LEIA,Han!
HAN,"Yes, Your Highnessness?"
LEIA,I thought you decided to stay.
HAN,"Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my  mind."
LEIA,"Han, we need you!"
HAN,We?
LEIA,Yes.
HAN,"Oh, what about you need?"
LEIA,I need? I don't know what you're talking about.
HAN,You probably don't.
LEIA,And what precisely am I supposed to know?
HAN,Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about  me.
LEIA,Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader...
HAN,No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh -- uh huh! Come on.
LEIA,You're imagining things.
HAN,Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave  without giving you a goodbye kiss?
LEIA,I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
HAN,I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!
THREEPIO,Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the  thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know.
THREEPIO,"Oh, switch off."
HAN,Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us  out of here and you pull both of these.
THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir."
HAN,Put them back together right now.
THREEPIO,"Might I have a word with you, please?"
HAN,What do you want?
THREEPIO,"Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you  on the communicator."
HAN,I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.
THREEPIO,"Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He  hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is."
HAN,I don't know where he is.
THREEPIO,Nobody knows where he is.
HAN,"What do you mean, \nobody knows\?"
THREEPIO,"Well, uh, you see..."
HAN,Deck Officer. Deck Officer!
THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-..."
HAN,Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?
HAN,It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out  there.
THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?"
HAN,Why not?
THREEPIO,"Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia.  Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger."
HAN,Not likely. Are the speeders ready?
HAN,Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
HAN,That's right. And my friends out in it.
HAN,Then I'll see you in hell!
THREEPIO,"You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more  we can do. And my joints are freezing up."
THREEPIO,"Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke  again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see.  Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right."
THREEPIO,"Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up  any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope."
THREEPIO,Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred  seventy-five...to one.
THREEPIO,"Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time  to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know...for a human being."
BEN,Luke...Luke.
BEN,You will go to the Dagobah system.
BEN,"There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed  me."
HAN,"Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here."
HAN,Not much time.
HAN,"Hang on, kid."
HAN,Whew...
HAN,"This may smell bad, kid..."
HAN,...but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built.   Ooh...I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
HAN,Good morning. Nice of you guys to  drop by.
THREEPIO,"Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional  again."
THREEPIO,"Artoo expresses his relief, also."
HAN,"How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact,  you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark."
HAN,"That's two you owe me, junior."
HAN,"Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a  little while longer."
LEIA,I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks  it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.
HAN,That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a  gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
LEIA,"I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain."
HAN,"Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south  passage."
HAN,She expressed her true feelings for me.
LEIA,"My...! Why, you stuck up,...half-witted,...scruffy-looking...  nerf-herder!"
HAN,"Who's scruffy-looking?  I must have hit her pretty close  to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?"
LEIA,"Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet?"
HAN,Take it easy.
THREEPIO,"Excuse us, please."
LEIA,Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.
HAN,"It could be a speeder, one of ours."
THREEPIO,"Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This  signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code."
HAN,"It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check  it out."
HAN,Afraid there's not much left.
LEIA,What was it?
HAN,Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It  must have had a self-destruct.
LEIA,An Imperial probe droid.
HAN,It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.
VADER,You found something?
VADER,That's it. The  Rebels are there.
VADER,"That is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set  your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men."
HAN,"Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it  off! Turn it off! Off!"
HAN,"Hi, kid.  There's got to be a reason for it. Check it  at the other end. Wait a second.  You all right?"
HAN,Be careful.
VADER,"What is it, General?"
VADER,The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel  came out of light-speed too close to the system.
VADER,"He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops  for a surface attack."
VADER,"You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett."
VADER,"Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and  deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett."
LEIA,"All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The  heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports."
LEIA,"The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any  enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood?"
LEIA,Good luck.
LEIA,"It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no  choice."
LEIA,Evacuate remaining ground staff.
HAN,"No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right?"
THREEPIO,"Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand?  And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear."
HAN,You all right?
LEIA,Why are you still here?
HAN,I heard the command center had been hit.
LEIA,You got your clearance to leave.
HAN,Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship.
THREEPIO,"Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our  only hope."
LEIA,Send all troops in sector twelve to the south  slope to protect the fighters.
HAN,Come on...that's it.
LEIA,Give the evacuation code signal. And get to  your transports!
THREEPIO,Oh! Wait for me!
HAN,"Transport, this is Solo. Better take off -- I  can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon."
THREEPIO,But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!!
THREEPIO,Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop!
THREEPIO,How typical.
HAN,Come on.
HAN,"Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident!"
THREEPIO,Wait! Wait!
HAN,How's this?
LEIA,Would it helped if I got out and pushed?
HAN,It might.
THREEPIO,"Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that  you..."
THREEPIO,It can wait.
LEIA,The bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
HAN,"This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart."
HAN,Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a  burnout.
HAN,See?
LEIA,"Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it."
HAN,Punch it!
HAN,I saw them! I saw them!
LEIA,Saw what?
HAN,"Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us."
THREEPIO,"Sir, sir! Might I suggest..."
HAN,Shut him up or shut him down!  Check the  deflector shield!
HAN,"Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them."
HAN,Prepare to make the jump to light-speed.
THREEPIO,"But, sir!"
LEIA,They're getting closer!
HAN,Oh yeah? Watch this.
LEIA,Watch what?
HAN,I think we're in trouble.
THREEPIO,"If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive  motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed!"
HAN,We're in trouble!
HAN,Horizontal boosters...!
HAN,Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it.
HAN,Bring me the hydrospanners!
HAN,I don't know how we're going to get out of this one.
HAN,Oww! Chewie!
HAN,That was no laser blast! Something hit us.
LEIA,"Han, get up here!"
HAN,"Come on, Chewie!"
LEIA,Asteroids!
HAN,"Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one."
LEIA,What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid  field?
HAN,"They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?"
LEIA,You don't have to do this to impress me.
THREEPIO,"Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid  field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one."
HAN,Never tell me the odds!
HAN,"You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well,  this could be it, sweetheart."
LEIA,I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out  here much longer.
HAN,I'm not going to argue with that.
THREEPIO,Pulverized?
HAN,I'm going in closer to one of the big ones.
LEIA,Closer?
THREEPIO,Closer?!
THREEPIO,"Oh, this is suicide!"
HAN,There. That looks pretty good.
LEIA,What looks pretty good?
HAN,Yeah. That'll do nicely.
THREEPIO,"Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?"
LEIA,I hope you know what you're doing.
HAN,"Yeah, me too."
VADER,"Yes, Admiral?"
VADER,"Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want  that ship and not excuses."
HAN,I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power  systems.
THREEPIO,"Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include  shutting me down, too?"
HAN,"No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with  the hyperdrive."
THREEPIO,"Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely  stable."
HAN,"Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these  things.  Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive."
THREEPIO,"Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After  all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most..."
LEIA,Let go.
HAN,Sshh!
LEIA,"Let go, please."
HAN,Don't get excited.
LEIA,"Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited."
HAN,"Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else."
THREEPIO,"Oh, where is Artoo when I need him?"
THREEPIO,"Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate,  but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it."
HAN,"Well, of course I'll have to replace it."
HAN,Here! And Chewie...
HAN,...I think we'd better replace the negative power  coupling.
HAN,"Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help."
LEIA,Would you please stop calling me that?
HAN,"Sure, Leia."
LEIA,"Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes."
HAN,"I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though.  Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right."
LEIA,Occasionally  maybe...when you aren't  acting like a scoundrel.
HAN,Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.
LEIA,Stop that.
HAN,Stop what?
LEIA,Stop that! My hands are dirty.
HAN,"My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?"
LEIA,Afraid?
HAN,You're trembling.
LEIA,I'm not trembling.
HAN,You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough  scoundrels in your life.
LEIA,I happen to like nice men.
HAN,I'm a nice man.
LEIA,"No, you're not. You're..."
THREEPIO,"Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling."
HAN,Thank you. Thank you very much.
THREEPIO,"Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir."
VADER,"No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to  sweep the asteroid field until they are found."
VADER,"Yes, Admiral, what is it?"
VADER,Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a  clear transmission.
VADER,"What is thy bidding, my master?"
VADER,I have felt it.
VADER,"Yes, my master."
VADER,He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.
VADER,"If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally."
VADER,"He will join us or die, my master."
BEN,He will learn patience.
YODA,"Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father."
BEN,Was I any different when you taught me?
YODA,Hah. He is not ready.
YODA,"Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years  have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.  This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things.  You are reckless!"
BEN,"So was I, if you'll remember."
YODA,"He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training."
YODA,Will he finished what he begins?
YODA,"Oh, you will be. You will be."
THREEPIO,"Sir, if I may venture an opinion..."
HAN,"I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio."
LEIA,There's something out there.
HAN,Where?
LEIA,"Outside, in the cave."
THREEPIO,There it is. Listen! Listen!
HAN,I'm going out there.
LEIA,Are you crazy?!
HAN,I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let  something tear it apart.
LEIA,Then I'm going with you.
THREEPIO,"I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the  ship.  Oh, no."
LEIA,This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at  all.
HAN,There's an awful lot of moisture in here.
LEIA,I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.
HAN,Yeah.
HAN,Watch out!
HAN,"Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of  the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables."
LEIA,Mynocks?
HAN,Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.
THREEPIO,Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo!
HAN,Wait a minute...
HAN,"All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!"
LEIA,The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to...
HAN,No time to discuss this as a committee.
LEIA,I am not a committee!
LEIA,You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field...
HAN,"Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off!"
THREEPIO,Look!
HAN,"I see it, I see it."
THREEPIO,We're doomed!
LEIA,The cave is collapsing.
HAN,This is no cave.
LEIA,What?
YODA,"Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of  the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice."
YODA,"No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive."
YODA,"You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses  the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack."
YODA,"No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I  teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm."
YODA,That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain  of evil it is. In you must go.
YODA,Only what you take with you.
YODA,Your weapons...you will not need them.
VADER,"...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds  the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations."
THREEPIO,"Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field."
HAN,Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three!
HAN,It's not fair!
HAN,The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!
LEIA,No light-speed?
HAN,It's not my fault.
THREEPIO,"Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more  direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for."
HAN,Turn her around.
HAN,I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front  shield.
LEIA,You're going to attack them?!
THREEPIO,"Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial  Star Destroyer..."
LEIA,Shut up!
YODA,Use the Force. Yes...
YODA,Now...the stone. Feel it.
YODA,Concentrate!
YODA,So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you  nothing that I say?
YODA,No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn  what you have learned.
YODA,No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.
YODA,"Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm?  Mmmm."
YODA,"And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a  powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we......not this crude matter.  You must feel the Force around you.  Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!"
YODA,That is why you fail.
VADER,"Apology accepted, Captain Needa."
VADER,Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along  their last know trajectory.
VADER,"Don't fail me again, Admiral."
THREEPIO,"Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far.  No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?"
HAN,The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand  by the manual release for the landing claw.
THREEPIO,I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a  perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...
HAN,Thank you.
LEIA,What did you have in mind for your next move?
HAN,"Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump  their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away."
LEIA,With the rest of the garbage. Then what?
HAN,Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any  ideas?
LEIA,No. Where are we?
HAN,The Anoat system.
LEIA,Anoat system. There's not much there.
HAN,"No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando."
LEIA,Lando system?
HAN,"Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card  player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him."
LEIA,Thanks.
HAN,"Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it."
LEIA,A mining colony?
HAN,"Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go  back a long way, Lando and me."
LEIA,Can you trust him?
HAN,"No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that."
HAN,"Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!"
LEIA,"You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them."
YODA,"Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through  the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone."
YODA,"Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control."
YODA,Mmm. Friends you have there.
YODA,It is the future you see.
YODA,Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
YODA,"Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help  them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered."
HAN,"No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying  to reach Lando Calrissian."
HAN,Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain.
THREEPIO,"Rather touchy, aren't they?"
LEIA,I thought you knew this person.
HAN,"Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's  forgotten about that."
HAN,Thank you.
HAN,"There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me."
LEIA,Who's worried?
THREEPIO,Oh. No one to meet us.
LEIA,I don't like this.
HAN,"Well, what would you like?"
THREEPIO,"Well, they did let us land."
HAN,"Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me."
HAN,"See? My friend.  Keep your eyes open, okay?"
THREEPIO,"Well, he seems very friendly."
LEIA,Yes...very friendly.
HAN,Ahh...repairs. I thought you could  help me out.
HAN,"Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square."
LEIA,Leia.
HAN,"All right, all right, you old smoothie."
THREEPIO,"Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My  facilities are at your..."
THREEPIO,"Well, really!"
HAN,Hyperdrive.
HAN,Good.
HAN,How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you?
HAN,"You. Listen to you -- you sound like a businessman, a responsible  leader. Who'd have thought that, huh?"
HAN,Yeah.
THREEPIO,Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.
THREEPIO,How rude!
THREEPIO,That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if...
THREEPIO,"Hello? How interesting. Oh, my."
THREEPIO,"Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No,  no, please don't get up. No!"
YODA,Luke! You must complete the training.
YODA,You must not go!
BEN,You don't know that.
BEN,Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
BEN,"But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when  you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force."
YODA,"Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure  at the cave!"
BEN,It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your  friends are made to suffer.
BEN,"Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost  Vader."
YODA,"Stopped they must be. On this depends. Only a fully trained Jedi  Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil."
BEN,Patience.
YODA,If you honor what they fight for...yes!
BEN,"If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot  interfere."
BEN,"Luke, don't give in to hate -- that leads to the dark side."
YODA,Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.
YODA,"Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse."
BEN,That boy is our last hope.
YODA,No. There is another.
HAN,The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're  in great shape.
LEIA,The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen  or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.
HAN,Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.
LEIA,I don't trust Lando.
HAN,"Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides,  we'll soon be gone."
LEIA,"And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?"
LEIA,What happened?
HAN,Where? Found him in a junk pile?
LEIA,"Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him?"
HAN,Lando's got people who can fix him.
LEIA,"No, thanks."
LEIA,Not really.
LEIA,Thank you.
HAN,No. No problem. Why?
LEIA,So you're part of the mining guild then?
HAN,Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this  little operation and shut you down?
VADER,We would be honored if you would join us.
HAN,"I'm sorry, too."
THREEPIO,"Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh -- Take this off! I, uh, don't mean  to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No!"
THREEPIO,"Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the  others. Oh, no! I've been shot!"
VADER,You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I  have Skywalker.
VADER,He will not be permanently damaged.
VADER,They must never again leave this city.
VADER,Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
VADER,Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison  here.
THREEPIO,"Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not  right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough..."
HAN,I feel terrible.
LEIA,Why are they doing this?
HAN,They never even asked me any questions.
LEIA,Lando.
HAN,"Get out of here, Lando!"
HAN,Over to you?
LEIA,What about Han?
LEIA,Vader wants us all dead.
HAN,Luke?
LEIA,And we're the bait.
HAN,"Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you?   My friend!"
HAN,"Yeah, you're a real hero."
LEIA,You certainly have a way with people.
VADER,"This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze  Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor."
VADER,Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.
VADER,I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on  Captain Solo.
THREEPIO,"If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this  ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish."
HAN,What's going on...buddy?
VADER,The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!
THREEPIO,"Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!"
HAN,"Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!"
THREEPIO,"Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die."
HAN,"Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey!"
HAN,Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess -- you  have to take care of her. You hear me?
LEIA,I love you!
HAN,I know.
THREEPIO,"What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see.  Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected -- if he survives the freezing process, that is."
VADER,"Well, Calrissian, did he survive?"
VADER,He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
VADER,"Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take  the princess and the Wookiee to my ship."
VADER,I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.
LEIA,"Luke! Luke, don't -- it's a trap! It's a trap!"
VADER,"The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi  yet."
LEIA,What do you think you're doing?
THREEPIO,I knew all along it had to be a mistake.
LEIA,Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust  you?
THREEPIO,"What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!"
LEIA,"Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice."
LEIA,We don't need any of your help.
LEIA,What?
THREEPIO,It sounds like Han.
LEIA,Chewie.
THREEPIO,"I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all,  he's only a Wookiee."
THREEPIO,Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been?
THREEPIO,"Turn around, you wooly...!  Hurry, hurry! We're  trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!"
THREEPIO,"Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened  to me!"
THREEPIO,"Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!"
VADER,"You have learned much, young one."
VADER,"Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be  true."
VADER,All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor  thought.
VADER,Impressive...most impressive.
VADER,Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear...  now release your anger.
VADER,Only your hatred can destroy me.
THREEPIO,"Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security  system."
THREEPIO,Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know  a power socket from a computer terminal.
THREEPIO,"What are you talking about? We're not interested in the  hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump."
THREEPIO,I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!
THREEPIO,"Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow!"
THREEPIO,"I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of  course, I've looked better."
VADER,You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be  destroyed as Obi-Wan did.
VADER,"There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet  realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy."
VADER,If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told  you what happened to your father.
VADER,No. I am your father.
VADER,Search your feelings. You know it to be true.
VADER,"Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is  your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way."
LEIA,Luke...We've got to go back.
LEIA,I know where Luke is.
LEIA,"Chewie, just do it."
VADER,Bring my shuttle.
LEIA,"It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him.  Lando, open the top hatch."
LEIA,"Okay. Easy, Chewie."
LEIA,Lando?
LEIA,I'll be back.
LEIA,Star Destroyer.
LEIA,If your people fixed the hyperdrive.
LEIA,All the coordinates are set. It's now or never.
VADER,Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium  Falcon?
VADER,Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for  stun.
THREEPIO,Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed?
THREEPIO,We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated?
THREEPIO,"The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know  better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!"
VADER,Luke.
VADER,"Son, come with me."
VADER,Luke...it is your destiny.
THREEPIO,"Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet!  You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur!"
THREEPIO,"Oh, you did it!"
