character,dialogue
YODA,"Worse than war, I fear... Muchworse. "
YODA,Impossible to see ... The Dark Sideclouds everything. But this I amsure of -(opens his eyes)Do their duty the Jedi will.
YODA,With you the force is strong...young Senator. To see you alivebrings warm feeling to my heart.
YODA,"In dark times nothing is what itappears to be, but the fact remainsSenator, in grave danger you are."
YODA,"Too little about yourself youworry, Senator, and too much aboutpolitics. Be mindful of yourdanger, Padmé. Accept our help."
OBI-WAN,"It's Good to see you, too, Jar Jar."
ANAKIN,"Hi, Jar Jar."
OBI-WAN,"It's a great pleasure to see you again,M'Lady."
OBI-WAN,I'm sure the Jedi Council havetheir reasons.
ANAKIN,"(trying to be smooth)So have you... grown morebeautiful, I mean... and muchshorter... for a Senator, I mean."
OBI-WAN,"Our presence will be invisible,M'Lady."
OBI-WAN,"(frowning)We're here to protect youSenator, not to start aninvestigation."
ANAKIN,"We will find out who is trying tokill you Padmé, I promise you."
OBI-WAN,"We are not going to exceed ourmandate, my young Padawan learner."
ANAKIN,"I meant in the interest ofprotecting her, Master, of course."
OBI-WAN,"We are not going through thisexercise again, Anakin. You willpay attention to my lead."
ANAKIN,Why?
OBI-WAN,What??!!
ANAKIN,"Why else do you think we wereassigned to her, if not to findthe killer? Protection is a jobfor local security... not Jedi.It's overkill, Master.Investigation is implied in ourmandate."
OBI-WAN,"We will do as the Council hasinstructed, and you will learnyour place, young one."
ANAKIN,"She didn't even recognise me, JarJar. I thought about her everyday since we parted... and she'sforgotten me completely."
OBI-WAN,"Anakin, you're focusing on theNegative again. Be mindful of yourthoughts. She was glad to see us.Now lets check the security here."
ANAKIN,"Yes, my master."
YODA,"Masking the future, is thisdisturbance in the Force."
YODA,And only those who have turned tothe Dark Side can sense thepossibilities of the future. Onlygoing through the Dark Side can wesee.
YODA,"...Out there, they are. Acertainty that is."
YODA,Only if he chooses to follow hisdestiny.
OBI-WAN,Captain Typho has more than enoughmen downstairs. No assassin willtry that way. Any activity uphere?
ANAKIN,Quiet as a tomb. I don't likejust waiting here for something tohappen to her.
OBI-WAN,What's going on?
ANAKIN,She covered that camera. I don'tthink she liked me watching her.
OBI-WAN,What is she thinking?
ANAKIN,She programmed Artoo to warn us ifthere's an intruder.
OBI-WAN,It's not an intruder I'm worriedabout. There are many other waysto kill a Senator.
ANAKIN,"I know, but we also want to catchthis assassin. Don't we, Master?"
OBI-WAN,You're using her as bait??
ANAKIN,It was her idea... No harm willcome to her. I can senseeverything going on in that room.Trust me.
OBI-WAN,"It's too risky... and your sensesaren't that attuned, youngapprentice."
ANAKIN,And yours are?
OBI-WAN,Possibly.
OBI-WAN,You look tired.
ANAKIN,"I don't sleep well, anymore."
OBI-WAN,Because of your mother?
ANAKIN,I don't know why I keep dreamingAbout her now. I haven't seen hersince I was little.
OBI-WAN,Dreams pass in time.
ANAKIN,I'd rather dream of Padmé. JustBeing around her again is...intoxicating.
OBI-WAN,"Mind your thoughts, Anakin, theybetray you. You've made acommitment to the Jedi order... acommitment not easily broken...and don't forget she's apolitician. They're not to betrusted."
ANAKIN,"She's not like the others in theSenate, Master."
OBI-WAN,It's been my experience thatSenators are only focused onpleasing those who fund theircampaigns... and they are morethan willing to forget theniceties of democracy to get thosefunds.
ANAKIN,"Not another lecture, Master. Noton the economics of politics....It's too early in the morning... andbesides, you're generalising. TheChancellor doesn't appear tobe corrupt."
OBI-WAN,"Palpatine's a politician, I'veobserved that he is very clever atfollowing the passions andprejudices of the Senators."
ANAKIN,I think he is a good man. Myinstincts are very positiveabout...
OBI-WAN,"I sense it, too."
ANAKIN,Stay here!
OBI-WAN,I have a bad feeling about this.
ANAKIN,That was wacky! I almost lost youin the traffic.
OBI-WAN,What took you so long?
ANAKIN,"Oh, you know, Master, I couldn'tfind a speeder I really liked,with an open cockpit... and withthe right speed capabilities...and then you know I had to get areally gonzo color..."
OBI-WAN,"If you'd spend as much timeworking on your saber skills asyou do on your wit, young Padawan,you would rival Master Yoda as aswordsman."
ANAKIN,I thought I already did.
OBI-WAN,"Only in your mind, my very youngapprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!"
ANAKIN,"Sorry, I forgot you don't likeflying, Master."
OBI-WAN,I don't mind flying... butwhat you're doing is suicide!
ANAKIN,"Master, you know I've been flyingsince before I could walk. I'm verygood at this."
OBI-WAN,Just slow down!
OBI-WAN,(continuing)Wait! Don't go in there!
OBI-WAN,(continuing)You know I don't like it when youdo that!
ANAKIN,"Sorry, Master. Don't worry, thisguy's gonna kill himself anyminute now!"
OBI-WAN,What are you doing? He's gonnablast me!
ANAKIN,Right - this isn't working.
OBI-WAN,That was too close!
ANAKIN,Clear that!
OBI-WAN,What??
ANAKIN,Clear the flag! We're losingpower! Hurry!
OBI-WAN,Whooooaaa! Don't do that! Idon't  like it when you do that!
ANAKIN,"So sorry, Master."
OBI-WAN,It's dangerous near those powercouplings! Slow down! Don't gothrough there!
OBI-WAN,"(continuing)Yiiii, what are you doing?"
ANAKIN,"Sorry, Master!"
OBI-WAN,"(sarcastically)Oh, that was good..."
ANAKIN,That was crazy!!!
ANAKIN,"(continuing)Ahh, damn."
OBI-WAN,Stop!!
ANAKIN,"No, we can make it."
OBI-WAN,I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'mcrazy.
ANAKIN,But it worked... we made it.
OBI-WAN,(angrily)It didn't work... we've stalled!And you almost got us killed!
ANAKIN,I think we're still alive.
OBI-WAN,(very angrily)It was stupid!
ANAKIN,(sheepishly)I could have made it...
OBI-WAN,(furious)But you didn't!!! And now we'velost him.
ANAKIN,No we didnt...
OBI-WAN,"Where are you going?! He wentdown there, the other way."
ANAKIN,This is a shortcut... I think.
OBI-WAN,"What do you mean, You think?What kind of shortcut?! He wentcompletely the other way! Youvelost him!"
ANAKIN,"Master, if we keep this chasegoing, that creeps gonna end updeep fried. Personally, Id verymuch like to find out who in thehell he is and who hes workingfor..."
OBI-WAN,"(sarcastic)Oh, so thats why were going inthe wrong direction."
OBI-WAN,"(continuing)Well, you lost him."
ANAKIN,"Im deeply sorry, Master."
ANAKIN,(continuing)Excuse me for a moment.
OBI-WAN,Anakin!
ANAKIN,"She went into that club, Master."
OBI-WAN,Patience.
OBI-WAN, (continuing)Here. Next time try not to lose it.
ANAKIN,"Sorry, Master."
OBI-WAN,A Jedi's saber is his mostprecious possession.
ANAKIN,"Yes, Master."
OBI-WAN,He must keep it with him at alltimes.
ANAKIN,"I know, Master."
OBI-WAN,This weapon is your life!
ANAKIN,I've heard this lesson before...
OBI-WAN,"But, you haven't learned anything,Anakin."
ANAKIN,"I try, Master."
OBI-WAN,Why do I think you are going to bethe death of me?!
ANAKIN,Don't say that Master... You'rethe closest thing I have to afather... I love you. I don't wantto cause you pain.
OBI-WAN,Then why don't you listen to me?!
ANAKIN,"I will. I'll do better, I promise."
OBI-WAN,Do you see him him?
ANAKIN,I think he's a she...
OBI-WAN,Then be extra careful...(nods to a room)Check it out.
ANAKIN,"Where are you going, Master?"
OBI-WAN,To get a drink.
OBI-WAN,You don't want to sell me death-sticks.
OBI-WAN,You want to go home and rethink your life.
ANAKIN,Easy... Official business. Goback to your drinks.
OBI-WAN,Do you know who it was you weretrying to kill?
OBI-WAN,Who hired you?
ANAKIN,Tell us!
OBI-WAN,This wound's going to needtreatment.
ANAKIN,Who hired you? Tell us... tell usnow!
OBI-WAN,Toxic Dart...
ANAKIN,"Don't worry. Now that the Councilhas ordered an investigation, itwon't take Master Obi-Wan long tofind that bounty hunter."
ANAKIN,Sometimes we have to let go of ourpride and do what is requested ofus.
ANAKIN,"Sorry, M'lady. I was only tryingto..."
ANAKIN,Please don't call me that.
ANAKIN,Annie...
ANAKIN,It's Anakin. When you say Annieit's like I'm still a littleboy... and I'm not.
ANAKIN,Master Obi-Wan manages not to seeit...
ANAKIN,"Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan isa great mentor. As wise as MasterYoda and as powerful as MasterWindu. I am truly thankful to behis apprentice. Only... althoughI'm a Padawan learner, in someways... a lot of ways... I'm aheadof him. I'm ready for the trials.I know I am! He knows it too. Hebelieves I'm too unpredictable...Other Jedi my age have gonethrough the trials and made it...I know I started my traininglate... but he won't let me moveon."
ANAKIN,It's worse... he's overlycritical. He never listens! Hejust doesn't understand! It's notfair!
ANAKIN,I'm not whining! I'm not.
ANAKIN,I know...
PADME,Anakin...
ANAKIN,I am grown up. You said ityourself.
ANAKIN,Why not?
ANAKIN,"(laughing)Ahh... so, you have Jedi powerstoo?"
ANAKIN,"Sorry, M'lady."
OBI-WAN,"Anakin, you stay put on Naboo.Do not attract any attention. Doabsolutely nothing withoutchecking in with me or the Council."
ANAKIN,"Yes, Master."
OBI-WAN,"(to Padme)I will get to the bottom of thisplot quickly, M'Lady. You'll beback here in no time."
ANAKIN,Time to go.
OBI-WAN,May the Force be with you.
ANAKIN,"May the Force be with you, Master."
ANAKIN,I'm kinda scared too. This is myfirst assignment on my own.
OBI-WAN,I hope he doesn't try anythingfoolish.
OBI-WAN,It's a toxic dart. I need to knowwhere it came from and who made it.
OBI-WAN,Excuse me? Could you try againplease?
OBI-WAN,"Thanks for your assistance! Youmay not be able to figure thisout, but I think I know someonewho might."
ANAKIN,"No, no, Mom, no..."
ANAKIN,(continuing)What?
ANAKIN,Thank you.
ANAKIN,I look forward to seeing Nabooagain. I've thought about it everyday since I left. It's by far themost beautiful place I've everseen...
ANAKIN,I think time has given me muchmore mature feelings to enhance myperception.
ANAKIN,Or be with the people I love.
ANAKIN,"Attachment is forbidden.Possession is forbidden.Compassion, which I would defineas unconditional love, is centralto a Jedi's life, so you might saywe're encouraged to love."
ANAKIN,You haven't changed a bit. You'reexactly the way I remember you inmy dreams. I doubt if Naboo haschanged much either.
ANAKIN,"I can't wait to breathe the sweetbreeze that comes off the rollinghills. Whenever I try tovisualise the Force, those hillsare what I see."
ANAKIN,(continuing)I love Naboo.
ANAKIN,"Yes... I left Tatooine so longago, my memory of her is fading.I don't want to lose it. RecentlyI've been seeing her in mydreams... vivid dreams... scarydreams. I worry about her."
OBI-WAN,I'm looking for Dexter.
OBI-WAN,He's not in trouble. It'spersonal.
OBI-WAN,"Hey, Dex."
OBI-WAN,Thank you.
OBI-WAN,"Hey, Dex."
OBI-WAN,You can tell me what this is.
OBI-WAN,Do you know where it came from?
OBI-WAN,Kamino Kyberdart... I wonder whyit didn't show up in any analysisarchive.
OBI-WAN,"Well, Dex, if droids could think, wewouldn't be here, would we?(laughing)Kamino... doesn't sound familiar.Is it part of the Republic?"
OBI-WAN,Cloners? Are they friendly?
OBI-WAN,"On what, Dex?"
ANAKIN,"If I grew up here, I don't thinkI'd ever leave."
ANAKIN,"No, really. When I started mytraining, I was very homesick andvery lonely. This city and my Momwere the only pleasant things Ihad to think about... The problemwas, the more I thought about myMom, the worse I felt. But Iwould feel better if I thoughtabout the palace - the way itshimmers in the sunlight - the waythe air always smells of flowers..."
ANAKIN,"Well, tell me, did you dream ofpower and politics when you werea little girl?"
ANAKIN,The people you served thought youdid a good job. I heard theytried to amend the Constitution soyou could stay in office.
ANAKIN,I agree! I think the Republicneeds you... I'm glad you choseto serve. I feel things are goingto happen in our generation thatwill change the galaxy in profoundways.
ANAKIN,"The Jedi have not been allowed toinvestigate. It would be to be toodangerous for the economy, we weretold."
ANAKIN,"(nettled)Hey, hold on a minute!"
ANAKIN,"Excuse me?! I am in charge ofsecurity here, M'Lady."
ANAKIN,"(takes a deep breath)Sorry, M'Lady."
OBI-WAN,"(distracted in thought)Yes... yes, I did..."
OBI-WAN,I never understood why he quit.Only twenty Jedi have ever leftthe Order.
OBI-WAN,What happened?
OBI-WAN,(surprised)Really?
OBI-WAN,Interesting... I'm still not sureI understand.
OBI-WAN,"Yes, I'm trying to find a planetsystem called Kamino. It doesn'tseem to show upon any of thearchive charts."
OBI-WAN,"(nodding)According to my information, itshould be in this quadrantsomewhere... just south of theRishi Maze."
OBI-WAN,All three actually.
OBI-WAN,Absolutely.
OBI-WAN,Wouldn't that be on record?
OBI-WAN,That's impossible... perhaps thearchives are incomplete.
PADME,There's my house!
PADME,(continuing)What? Don't say you're shy!
ANAKIN,"(untruthfully)No, but I..."
PADME,Ryoo!! Pooja!!
PADME,"(continuing)I'm so happy to see you! This isAnakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, andthis is Pooja."
PADME,"Anakin, this is my sister, Sola."
ANAKIN,Hello.
ANAKIN,A little.
PADME,"He's being polite, Mom. We'restarving."
PADME,(rolls her eyes)Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend!He's a Jedi assigned by the Senateto protect me.
PADME,"It's not, Mom, I promise.(glances at Jobal)Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I'veknown him for years. Rememberthat little boy who was with theJedi during the blockade crisis?"
PADME,(continuing)He grew up.
PADME,"Mom, I'm not in any danger."
ANAKIN,...Yes... I'm afraid she is.
PADME,(quickly)But not much.
ANAKIN,Padme tells me you teach at theuniversity?
ANAKIN,"There have been two attempts onher life. Chances are there'll bemore. My Master is tracking downthe assassins. I'm sure he'll findout who they are. This situation,won't last long."
ANAKIN,I don't either.
PADME,"Don't worry, this won't take long."
ANAKIN,I just want to get there beforedark.
ANAKIN,(continuing)You still live at home.
PADME,"I move around so much, I've neverhad a place of my own. Officialresidences have no warmth. I feelgood here. I feel at home."
ANAKIN,I never had a real home. Home wasalways where my Mom was.
ANAKIN,(continuing)Is this you?
PADME,"That was when I went with theRelief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran.Their sun was imploding, and theplanet was dying. I was helpingto relocate the children. Seethat little one I'm holding? Hisname was N'a-kee-tula, which meanssweethear. He was so full of life,. All those kids were. I dideverything I could to save him,but he died... they all did. Theywere never able to adapt... tolive off their native planet."
PADME,(continuing)My first day as an ApprenticeLegislator. Notice the difference?
YODA,"Don't think... feel... be as onewith the Force. Help you, it will.(he sees Obi-Wan)Younglings - enough! A visitor wehave. Welcome him."
YODA,"(continuing)Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet themighty Bear Clan."
OBI-WAN,"I am sorry to disturb you, Master."
YODA,"What help to you, can I be?"
OBI-WAN,Im looking for a planet describedto me by an old friend. I trusthim. But the system doesnt showup on the archive maps.
YODA,"An interesting puzzle. Gatherround the map reader, younglings.Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet.Find it, we will try..."
OBI-WAN,This is where it ought to be...but it isnt. Gravity is pullingall the stars in this area inwardto this spot. There should be astar here... but there isnt.
YODA,"Most interesting. Gravityssilhouette remains, but the starand all its planets havedisappeared. How can this be?"
YODA,"Truly wonderful, the mind of achild is. Uncluttered. To thecentre of the pull of gravity go,and find your planet you will."
OBI-WAN,"But Master Yoda who could haveerased information from thearchives? Thats impossible,isnt it?"
YODA,"(frowning)Much harder to answer, thatquestion is."
ANAKIN,I do too. I guess it comes fromgrowing up on a desert planet.
ANAKIN,"I dont like sand. Its coarseand rough and irritating, and itgets everywhere. Not like here.Here everythings soft... andsmooth..."
ANAKIN,(looks into her eyes)Everything here is magical.
ANAKIN,"Sometimes, when you believesomething to be real, it becomesreal. Real enough, anyway..."
ANAKIN,I think it's true...
ANAKIN,"I'm sorry. When I'm around you,my mind is no longer my own."
ANAKIN,...the view.
OBI-WAN,I am concerned for my Padawan. Heis not ready to be on his own.
YODA,"The Council is confident in this decision,Obi-Wan."
OBI-WAN,But he still has much to learn.And his abilities have made him...well... arrogant. I realise nowwhat you and Master Yoda knew fromthe beginning... the boy was tooold to start the training and...
OBI-WAN,"Master, he should not have beengiven this assignment. I'm afraidAnakin won't be able to protectthe Senator. "
OBI-WAN,He has a... an emotionalconnection with her. It's beenthere since he was boy. Nowhe's confused... distracted.
OBI-WAN,Has Master Yoda gained any insightinto whether or not this war willcome about?
PADME,You did that?
ANAKIN,What?
PADME,That! Now stop it!
PADME,(continuing)Anakin!!
ANAKIN,"I'm not really supposed to dothat... for fun, I mean. IfMaster Obi-Wan were here, he'd bevery grumpy."
ANAKIN,May I tell you something?
PADME,I don't know.
ANAKIN,Then how can I tell you?
PADME,Maybe you should use your Jediintuition.
ANAKIN,It doesn't work around you. Mymind is always a muddle... I canonly think of you.
PADME,"Anakin, don't..."
ANAKIN,"From the moment I met you, allthose years ago, a day hasn't goneby when I haven't thought of you.And now that I'm close to you again,I'm in agony. The closer I get toyou, the worse it gets. Thethought of not being with youmskes my stomach turn over - mymouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. Ican't breathe. I'm haunted by thekiss you should never have givenme. My heart is beating, hopingthat kiss will not become a scar.You are in my very soul,tormenting me. What can I do? Iwill do anything you ask..."
ANAKIN,"(continuing)If you are suffering as much as Iam, tell me."
PADME,...I can't. We can't. It's justnot possible.
ANAKIN,"Anything's possible. Padme,please listen..."
PADME,"You listen. We live in a realworld. Come back to it. You'restudying to become a Jedi Knight.I'm a Senator. If you follow yourthoughts through to conclusion,they will take us to a place wecannot go... regardless of the waywe feel about each other."
ANAKIN,Then you do feel something!There's an extraordinaryconnection between us. You can'tdeny that.
PADME,"Annie, it doesn't make anydifference. Jedi aren't allowedto marry. You swore an oath,remember? You'd be expelled fromthe Order. I will not let yougive up your responsibilities...your future, for me."
ANAKIN,I was destined to be a Jedi. Idon't think I could be anythingelse. But you are asking me to berational. That is something Iknow I cannot do. I wish I couldwish my feelings away... but Ican't.
PADME,I am not going to give into this.I'm not going to throw my lifeaway. I have more important thingsto do than fall in love.
ANAKIN,It wouldn't have to be that way...we could keep it a secret.
PADME,"Then we'd be living a lie - one wecouldn't keep even if we wantedto. Mt sister saw it. So did mymother. I couldn't do that.Could you, Anakin? Could you livelike that?"
ANAKIN,"...No, you're right. It woulddestroy us."
OBI-WAN,(warily)I'm expected?
OBI-WAN,Obi-Wan Kenobi.
OBI-WAN,You make me feel most welcome.
OBI-WAN,(improvising)That is... good news.
OBI-WAN,I'm sorry Master - ?
OBI-WAN,"Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas."
OBI-WAN,That's why I'm here.
ANAKIN,Sure you do... you just don't wantto tell me.
ANAKIN,They only work on the weak-minded.You are anything but weak-minded.
ANAKIN,"All right, I get the picture...whatever happened to him?"
ANAKIN,Maybe he was the smart one.
PADME,"You really don't like politicians,do you?"
ANAKIN,"I like two or three, but I'm notreally sure about one of them.(smiling)I don't think the system works."
PADME,How would you have it work?
ANAKIN,"We need a system where thepoliticians sit down and discussthe problems, agree what's in thebest interests of all the people,and then do it."
PADME,"That is exactly what we do. Thetrouble is that people don'twlways agree. In fact, theyhardly ever do."
ANAKIN,Then they should be made to.
PADME,By whom? Who's going to make them?
ANAKIN,I don't know. Someone.
PADME,You?
ANAKIN,Of course not me.
PADME,But someone.
ANAKIN,Someone wise.
PADME,That sounds an awful lot like adictatorship to me.
ANAKIN,"Well, if it works..."
ANAKIN," (sarcastic)On no, I'd be much too frightenedto tease a Senator."
ANAKIN,You're always so serious. Alwayscarrying the weight of theuniverse on your shoulders.
OBI-WAN,Where is this bounty hunter now?
OBI-WAN,Unaltered?
OBI-WAN,I would like to meet this JangoFett.
OBI-WAN,You mentioned growthacceleration...
OBI-WAN,And these?
OBI-WAN,Very impressive.
OBI-WAN,"(carefully)Tell me, prime minister, when myMaster Sido-dyas first contactedyou, did he say the order wasfor... himself... or?"
OBI-WAN,(astonished)The Repubic?
OBI-WAN,"Arfour, Arfour..."
OBI-WAN,"Arfour, relay this, ""scramble codefive,"" to Courscant: care of ""theold folks home."""
YODA,"Who he is working for... discoverthat, you must."
YODA,"Inform the chancellor of this, wemust."
ANAKIN,"No...No...No...Mom!...Don't,no, don't!"
ANAKIN,(eyes closed)Don't go.
ANAKIN,Your presence is soothing.
PADME,You had a nightmare again lastnight.
ANAKIN,Jedi don't have nightmares.
PADME,I heard you.
ANAKIN,"I saw my mother. I saw her asclearly as I see you now. She'ssuffering, Padme. She is inpain...They're killing her!(getting up)I know I'm disobeying my mandateto protect you, Senator. I know Iwill be punished and possiblythrown out of the Jedi Order, butI must go. I have to help her!I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have achoice."
PADME,"Annie, I told you I wouldn't letyou give up your future for me.I'll go with you. That way youcan continue to protect me, andyou won't be disobeying yourmandate."
ANAKIN,What about Master Obi-wan?
PADME,"I guess we won't tell him, will we?"
OBI-WAN,Your clones are very impressive.You must be very proud.
OBI-WAN,Aren't we all?
OBI-WAN,(continuing)Ever made your way as far into theinterior as Coruscant?
OBI-WAN,Recently?
OBI-WAN,Then you must know Master Sido-Dyas?
OBI-WAN,Sido-Dyas. Isnt he the Jedi whohired you for this job?
OBI-WAN,No? I thought...
OBI-WAN,Curious...
OBI-WAN,It seems to me it's your army -being that they are all clones ofyou.
OBI-WAN,"I look forward to seeing them inaction. Thank you for your time,Jango."
ANAKIN,"(to the droid driver)Wait, please."
ANAKIN,"(arriving)Excuse me, Watto."
ANAKIN,(in Huttese)I said excuse me.
ANAKIN,Let me help you with that.
ANAKIN,(continuing)I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.
ANAKIN,My mother...
ANAKIN,Sold her...
ANAKIN,Do you know where they are?
ANAKIN,I'd like to know.
OBI-WAN,I won't forget.
PADME,"Stay with the ship, Artoo."
C-3PO,Good evening. May I help you?
ANAKIN,Threepio?
C-3PO,"Oh, my... oh, my! MasterAnakin! My goodness, I can hardlybelieve it! And this must be MissPadme."
PADME,"Hello, Threepio."
ANAKIN,I've come to see my mother.
C-3PO,"Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry,Master Annie."
PADME,"Threepio, what's happened?"
C-3PO,I think we'd better go inside.
C-3PO,Master Lars - Master Owen!Somebody to see you!
ANAKIN,I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm herelooking for my mother.
PADME,I'm Padme.
ANAKIN,Is my mother here?
ANAKIN,To find my mother.
PADME,"No, Annie!"
ANAKIN,"I can feel her pain, and I willfind her. I know she's alive."
ANAKIN,"You are going to have to stayhere. These are good people,Padme. You'll be safe."
PADME,Anakin...
ANAKIN,"I trust you'll watch over her,Owen."
ANAKIN,I won't be long.
C-3PO,"Please don't leave us, Miss Padme.These people need your help."
PADME,"I'm not leaving, Threepio. I justcan't sleep."
C-3PO,"That's something I cannot relateto. As a Protocol Droid, I'meither active or inactive.There's no in-between."
PADME,I guess you're lucky.
C-3PO,Do you really think so..? Isuppose I shouldn't expect...
PADME,You're not happy here?
C-3PO,"Oh, I'm not unhappy... and mymasters here ar so kind Iwouldn't wish to trouuble them,it's just... being like this...well, it's embarrassing."
PADME,Being like what?
C-3PO,"Naked. If you pardon theexpression. You see, when MasterAnnie made me, he never quitefound the time to give me anyouter covering. It's sohumiliating. How would you like itif you had to go around with allyour circuits showing?"
PADME,I guess I wouldn't like it at all.
C-3PO,Of course you wouldn't. Nobodywould. It's simply not protocol.
PADME,Maybe we can do something about it.
C-3PO,I don't think so. Only MasterAnnie...
PADME,Why not? They seem to have a boxof old coverings here.
C-3PO,"Oh? How observant of you, MissPadme. Of course, I'm just notmechanically minded... if you seewhat I mean."
PADME,"Let's see, if we put this...here..."
C-3PO,Ooooh! That's tickles.

OBI-WAN,...Starships from the TradeFederation and the Commerce Guildsare taking deliveries of battledroids from the foundries onGeonosis.
OBI-WAN,The droid foundry seems to beworking at full capacity. I amgoing to go down and investigate.I will bring Jango Fett back homefor interrogation.
OBI-WAN,One more thing. Jango mentionedhe was recruited by someone namedDarth Tyranus. Any idea who thatmight be?
YODA,"With the forename Darth, a Sith hemust be."
OBI-WAN,"Do you believe he could be themysterious Sido-Dyas, who made thedeal for the clone army?"
YODA,"Perhaps too many pieces are missingfrom this puzzle, there are."
OBI-WAN,Let me see if I can figure outwhat's going on first.
YODA,"Two Hundred,... less or more."
PADME,There!
C-3PO,Um. How do I look?
C-3PO,"Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I'm sohappy!(extending his hand to shake hers)Oh, pardon me."
THREEPIO,(continuing)Thank you.

C-3PO,"Oh, my!"
OBI-WAN,...Alliance have pledged theirarmies to Count Dooku and areforming an... Wait!... ah...attack... I don't... make it...aaaggghhh!
ANAKIN,I'm going after him!
PADME,I thought the first thing he saidwas to retransmit his message toCoruscant.
ANAKIN,"Yeah, you're right, you're right."
ANAKIN,"Understood, Master."
PADME,"They'll never get there in time tosave him. They have to come halfway across the galaxy. Look,Geonosis is less than a parsec away."
ANAKIN,If he's still alive.
PADME,"Annie, are you just going to sithere and let him die?? He's yourfriend... your mentor..."
ANAKIN,"...He's like my father, but youheard Master Windu. He gave mestrict orders to stay here."
PADME,He gave you strict orders toprotect me...
PADME,"(continuing)...and I'm going to save Obi-Wan.So if you plan to protect me, youwill have to come along."
YODA,"Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundredJedi send. Enough, let's hopethey are."
ANAKIN,"Hey, where are you going?"
PADME,To find Obi-Wan.
ANAKIN,No! You're not!
PADME,Let go of me!
ANAKIN,I'm not letting you go out there.It's too dangerous.
ANAKIN,"It's my job to protect you. I saidit's too dangerous. You're notgoing, and that's final!"
C-3PO,"Yes, it is, Artoo. Mostconfusing. One moment they'regenerating a pleasant mutualattraction and the next, waves ofviolent hostility. Even thoughI'm programmed to understand them,I doubt if I ever shall."
PADME,(in a low voice)It's empty!
PADME,Wait!
ANAKIN,Don't be afraid.
ANAKIN,What are you talking about?
ANAKIN,You love me?! I thought wedecided not to fall in love. Thatwe would be forced to live a lie.That it would destroy our lives...
ANAKIN,"I have no desire to be cured ofthis love either. Long or short,I vow to spend the rest of my lifewith you."
OBI-WAN,I was beginning to wonder if youhad gotten my message.
ANAKIN,"I retransmitted it as yourequested, Master. Then we decidedto come and rescue you."
OBI-WAN,It looks like you're going a goodjob so far.
ANAKIN,I have a bad feeling about this.
OBI-WAN,Take the one the left. I'lltake the one on the right.
ANAKIN,What about Padme?
OBI-WAN,It looks like she's already on topof things.
ANAKIN,You okay?
PADME,"(nods, gasping)Sure! Well, sort of."
ANAKIN,Jump!!!
C-3PO,"Yes, it has been rather a longtime. Do you suppose something'shappened to them?"
C-3PO,"(continuing)Danger? Oh no, I shouldn't thinkso. It looks a very dull planetto me. They should be backshortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo."
C-3PO,I don't hear anything.(Artoo beeps)You're scaring me! Stop imaginingthings!
OBI-WAN,Someone's got to - shut down -these droids.
PADME,Look!
YODA,Come on - hurry! Hurry!
YODA,"More battalions to the left.Encircle them we must, thendivide."
C-3PO,"I'm sure I heard something, thistime. Didn't you? It's probablyjust a celebration"
OBI-WAN,Hold on! Look over there...
ANAKIN,"It's Dooku, go after him!"
ANAKIN,(continuing)Padme!!!
ANAKIN,(continuing; to pilot)Put the ship down! Down!
OBI-WAN,No! Forget her. We have to goafter Dooku.
ANAKIN,No we're not!! Land this ship!
OBI-WAN,Don't let your personal feelingsget in the way. We've got a job todo.
ANAKIN,I don't care!.. Go back.
OBI-WAN,Anakin! She's all right! Look.
OBI-WAN,(continuing)Follow that speeder!
OBI-WAN,(to Anakin)We move in together - you slowlyon the...
ANAKIN,I'm taking him now!
OBI-WAN,"Anakin, no!"
ANAKIN,"You'll pay for all the Jedi you'vekilled today, Dooku."
OBI-WAN,I don't think so.
OBI-WAN,You will have to prove it.
ANAKIN,I'm a slow learner.
ANAKIN,Don't bet on it!
OBI-WAN,Anakin!
YODA,"Count Dooku. No interest incontests, do I have."
YODA,"(continuing)The end for you, Count, this is."
OBI-WAN,On his way back to Naboo. He isescorting Senator Amidala home.
OBI-WAN,"(continuing)I must admit without the clones,it would not have been a victory."
YODA,"Victory? Victory, you say?"
YODA,"(continuing)Not victory, a defeat, it was...Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the CloneWar has!"
