OBI-WAN,I have a bad feeling about this.
OBI-WAN,"It's not about the mission, Master, it's"
OBI-WAN,Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future...
OBI-WAN,"Yes, Master...how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with"
OBI-WAN,"Offhand, I'd say this mission is past the negotiaion stage."
OBI-WAN,They have shield generators!
OBI-WAN,It's an invisible army.
OBI-WAN,"You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were"
OBI-WAN,"Sorry, Master, the water fried my weapon."
OBI-WAN,"Yes, Master."
OBI-WAN,What's this?
OBI-WAN,"When they find us, they will crush us, grind us into little"
OBI-WAN,"Don't worry, this has not been our day for warm welcomes."
OBI-WAN,"After those droids take control of the surface, they will come"
OBI-WAN,You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle. What happens to noe of
OBI-WAN,"Master, whats a bongo?"
OBI-WAN,"We are short of time, Master."
OBI-WAN,"Master, why do you keep dragging these pathetic life forms along"
OBI-WAN,"Why were you banished, Jar Jar?"
OBI-WAN,They banished you because you're clumsy?
OBI-WAN,Give me the controls.
OBI-WAN,.....we're losing power.
OBI-WAN,Power's back.
OBI-WAN,You overdid it.
OBI-WAN,What is it?
OBI-WAN,Get up here!
OBI-WAN,That was close.
PADME,"We are brave, Your Highness."
OBI-WAN,I'll take care of that. OBI-WAN heads toward the group of
OBI-WAN,"Now stay here, and keep out of trouble."
OBI-WAN,"Here, Master. Tatooine... It's small, out of the way, poor... The"
OBI-WAN,It's risky...but there's no alternative.
PADME,That's all right.
PADME,Thank you. This little guy is quite a mess.
OBI-WAN,Tahyt's it. Tatooine.
OBI-WAN,"Sorry, Qui-Gon's right. You'll make things less obvious."
OBI-WAN,(Cant'd) The Hyperdrive generator is gone. We will need a new
OBI-WAN,"I fell it also, Master."
PADME,I've been trained in defense... I can take care of myself.
PADME,....like us. JAR JAR is in a constant state of panic.

PADME,You're a funny little boy. How do you know so much?
ANAKIN,"Since I was very little, three, I think. My Mom and I were sold to"
PADME,You're...a slave?
ANAKIN,I am a person! My name is Anakin.
PADME,I'm sorry. I don't fully understand. (looking around)This is a
ANAKIN,You are a strange girl to me.
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) Hit the nose!
ANAKIN,...wouldn't have lasted long if I weren't so good at fixing
PADME,"I'm glad I met you,....ah..."
ANAKIN,...Anakin.
PADME,Anakin.
ANAKIN,Anakin Skywalker.
PADME,Padme Naberrie.
ANAKIN,I'm glad I met you too.
ANAKIN,(subtitled) La lova num botaffa. (They seemed nice to me.) WATTO :
OBI-WAN,"(V.O) A few containers of supplies, the Queen's wardrobe, maybe."
ANAKIN,(V.O) Because you're afraid.
ANAKIN,"(subtitled) Chess ko, Sebulba...Coo wolpa tooney rana. (Careful,"
ANAKIN,(subtitled) Oh da Hutt...cha porko ootman geesa...me teesa rodda
ANAKIN,"(subtitled) Eh, chee bana do mullee ra. (Yeah, it'd be a pity if"
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) Hi! Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange
ANAKIN,Fear attracts the fearful. He was trying to overcome his fear by
PADME,And that works for you.
ANAKIN,To a point. (he smiles)
OBI-WAN,This storm's going to slow them down.
ANAKIN,"How are you feeling today, Jira?"
ANAKIN,Guess what? I've found that cooling unit I've been searching for.
ANAKIN,I'll take four pallies today. (to Padme) You'll like these...
ANAKIN,"(Cont'd) Whoops, I thought I had more...Make thgat three, I'm not"
ANAKIN,(to QUI-GON) Do you have shelter?
ANAKIN,Is it far?
PADME,On the outskirts.
ANAKIN,"You'll never reach the outskirts in time...sandstorms are very,"
ANAKIN,Mom! Mom! I'm home.
ANAKIN,"These are my friends, Mom. This is Padme, and...gee, I don't know"
PADME,"...and our droid, Artoo-Detoo."
ANAKIN,I'm building a droid. You wanna see?
ANAKIN,"A sandstorm, Mom. Listen."
ANAKIN,Come on! Let me show you Threepio!
ANAKIN,Isn't he great?! He's not finished yet.
PADME,He's wonderful!
ANAKIN,You reall like him? He's a protocol droid...to help Mom. Watch!
THREEPIO,"How do you do, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations. How"
PADME,He's perfect.
ANAKIN,"When the storm is over, you can see my racer. I'm building a"
THREEPIO,I beg your pardon....what do you mean I'm naked?
THREEPIO,"(Cont'd) My parts are showing? Oh, my goodness. How"
OBI-WAN,It's a trick. Send no reply... Send no transmission of any kind.
OBI-WAN,...the Queen is upset...but absolutly no reply was sent.
OBI-WAN,What if it is true and the people are dying?
ANAKIN,"I've been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no"
ANAKIN,...and they blow you up...poof!
PADME,I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The
ANAKIN,Have you ever seen a Podrace?
ANAKIN,I'm the only human who can do it.
ANAKIN,"(Cont'd) Mom, what? I'm not bragging. It's true. Watto says he's"
ANAKIN,I...I was wondering...something...
ANAKIN,"Well, ahhh...you're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?"
ANAKIN,I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.
ANAKIN,I don't think so... No one can kill a Jedi Knight.
ANAKIN,I think you have...why else would you be here?
ANAKIN,Coruscant...wow...how did you end up here in the outer rim?
PADME,"Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair"
ANAKIN,I can help! I can fix anything!
PADME,These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.
ANAKIN,I've built a racer! It's the fastest ever...There's a big race
ANAKIN,Watto doesn't know I've built it. (to Qui-Gon) You could make him
ANAKIN,"But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they're in trouble. The"
ANAKIN,"We have to help them, Mom...you said that the biggest problem in"
PADME,I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We will
ANAKIN,Is that a yes? That is a yes!
PADME,Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know.
PADME,"Well, I don't approve."
ANAKIN,"Bayno, Bayno!"
ANAKIN,Ahhhh....it wasn't my fault really...Sebulba flashed me with his
OBI-WAN,"What if this plan fails, Master? We could be stuck here for a"
ANAKIN,"Padme and Jar Jar, this is my friend Kitster, and seek, Amee, and"
ANAKIN,This isn't the half of it. I'm entered in the Boonta Race
ANAKIN,Hey! Jar Jar! Stay away from those energy binders...
ANAKIN,"If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours."
ANAKIN,It will.
ANAKIN,There are so many! Do they all have a system of planets?
ANAKIN,Has anyone been to them all?
ANAKIN,I want to be the first one to see them all... Ouch!
ANAKIN,What are you doing?
ANAKIN,I've never seen...
OBI-WAN,"Yes, Master."
OBI-WAN,Wait a minute...
OBI-WAN,All right. I've got it.
OBI-WAN,Something must be wrong with the transmission.
OBI-WAN,"Strange. The transmission seems to be in good order, but the"
OBI-WAN,Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high!
OBI-WAN,What does it mean?
PADME,I hope you're about finished.
ANAKIN,You were in my dream...you were leading a huge army into battle.
PADME,I hope not; I hate fighting. Your mother wants you to come in and
ANAKIN,"Hook 'em up, Kitster. (to Padme) I won't be long. Where's Qui-Gon?"
PADME,He and Jar Jar left already. They're with Watto at the arena.
ANAKIN,What did he mean by that?
THREEPIO,Oh my! Space travel sounds rather perilous.
THREEPIO,I can assure you they will never get me onto one of those
PADME,Do what?
PADME,You've never won a race?
ANAKIN,Well...not exactly...
PADME,Not even finished?!
ANAKIN,"...but Kitster's right, I will this time."
JABBA,"(subtitled) Chowbaso! Tam ka chee Boonta rulee ya, kee madda"
ANAKIN,"I will, Mom. I promise."
JABBA,"...Mawhonic tuta Hok, Teemto Pagalies tuta Moonus Mandel, Anakin"
PADME,You carry all our hopes.
ANAKIN,I won't let you down.
ANAKIN,"(subtitled) Cha skrundee da pat, sleemo. (Don't count on it,"
JABBA,(sutitled)...Ka bazza kundee hodrudda! (...Let the challenge
PADME,You Jedi are far too reckless. The Queen...
PADME,You assume too much.
PADME,Here he comes!
THREEPIO,He has to complete two more circuits? Oh dear!
ANAKIN,"Ah, gee...enough of this..."
PADME,We owe you everything.
ANAKIN,Just feeling this good was worth it.
OBI-WAN,Why do I sense we've picked up another pathetic life form...?
ANAKIN,He said I cheated.
ANAKIN,No!
ANAKIN,(suddenly beaming) Yes!
ANAKIN,"Mom, he sold the Pod. Look at all the money we have!"
ANAKIN,What?!?
ANAKIN,"Did you hear that, Mom? (to Qui-Gon) Was that part of the prize,"
ANAKIN,"A Jedi! Mighty blasters, you mean I get to go with you in your"
ANAKIN,"But it's what I want. What I've always dreamed about. Can I go,"
ANAKIN,I want to go.
ANAKIN,Yipee!!
ANAKIN,"(Cont'd) What about Mom? Is she free too? You're coming, aren't"
ANAKIN,But the money from selling...
ANAKIN,I want to stay with you. I don't want things to change.
ANAKIN,"I'm going to miss you so much, Mom..."
ANAKIN,"Well, Threepio, I'm free...and I'm going away...in a starship..."
THREEPIO,"Master, Annie, you are my maker, and I wish you well. Although"
ANAKIN,"I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you, Threepio...give you"
THREEPIO,Sell me?!?
ANAKIN,I... (looks to SHMI) I... have to go.
ANAKIN,Well.
ANAKIN,I won't forget.
ANAKIN,"(starting to cry) I can't do it, Mom. I just can't."
ANAKIN,Will I ever see you again?
ANAKIN,I hope so...yes...I guess.
ANAKIN,"I.. will become a Jedi and I will come back and free you, Mom...I"
ANAKIN,I love you so much.
ANAKIN,"I've been freed, and I'm going away. Buy yourself a cooling unit"
ANAKIN,Sure.
ANAKIN,What is it?
ANAKIN,"Master Qui-Gon,sir, wait!"
ANAKIN,Qui-Gon's in trouble. He says to take off...now!!
PADME,He's a friend.
OBI-WAN,Over there! Fly low!
ANAKIN,Are you all right?
OBI-WAN,What was it?
ANAKIN,Do you think he'll follow us?
ANAKIN,What are we going to do about it?
ANAKIN,Pleased to meet you. Wow! You're a Jedi too?
PADME,Are you all right?
ANAKIN,It's very cold.
PADME,"You're from a warm planet, Annie. Too warm for my taste. Space is"
ANAKIN,You seem sad.
PADME,The Queen is...worried. Her people are suffering...dying. She must
ANAKIN,I'm...I'm not sure what's going to happen to me. I dunno if I'll
PADME,"It's beautiful, but I don't need this to remember you. Many things"
ANAKIN,I care for you too. Only I...miss...
PADME,...You miss your mother.
ANAKIN,Wow! It's so huge!
ANAKIN,Don't look at me. I don't know what's going on.
YODA,"The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are."
YODA,"Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this assassin is, we"
YODA,"With this Naboo queen you must stay, Qui-Gon. Protect her."
YODA,May the Force be with you.
YODA,(Cont'd) Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?
YODA,"A vergence, you say?"
YODA,But you do! Rrevealed your opinion is.
YODA,"Trained as a Jedi, you request for him?"
YODA,Tested he will be.
ANAKIN,"I'm...I'm looking for the handmaiden, Padme."
ANAKIN,"I'd like to speak with Padme, if I could."
ANAKIN,"I'm going to the Jedi temple to start my training, I hope."
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) I may not see her again...and... I just wanted to say
ANAKIN,"Thank you, Your Highness. I'm sorry to have disturbed you."
OBI-WAN,"The boy will not pass the Council's tests, Master, and you know"
OBI-WAN,"Don't defy the Council, Master..not again."
OBI-WAN,"Master, you could be sitting on the Council by now if you would"
ANAKIN,A ship...a cup...a speeder.
YODA,"Good, good, young one. How feel you?"
ANAKIN,"Cold, sir."
YODA,Afraid are you?
ANAKIN,"No, sir."
ANAKIN,I don't think so.
YODA,"See through you, we can."
ANAKIN,I miss her.
YODA,Afraid to lose her..I think.
ANAKIN,(a little angry) What's that got to do with anything?
YODA,Eveything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to
ANAKIN,(angrily) I am not afraid!
YODA,"A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. I"
ANAKIN,(quietly) I am not afraid.
YODA,"Then continue, we will."
YODA,"...Correct you were, Qui-Gon."
YODA,"Clouded, this boy's future is. Masked by his youth."
YODA,"An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second."
OBI-WAN,Iam ready to face the trials.
YODA,"Ready so early, are you? What know you of ready?"
YODA,"Our own council we will keep on who is ready. More to learn, he"
YODA,And draw out the Queen's attacker.
YODA,Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.
YODA,"Train him not. Take him with you, but train him not!"
YODA,May the Force be with you.
OBI-WAN,"It is not disrespect, Master, it is the truth."
OBI-WAN,The boy is dangerous...they all sense it. Why can't you?
ANAKIN,"Master Qui-Gon, sir, I do not wish to be a problem."
ANAKIN,"Master, sir...I've been wondering...what are midi-chlorians?"
ANAKIN,They live inside of me?
ANAKIN,Symbionts?
ANAKIN,They do??
ANAKIN,I don't understand.
ANAKIN,...and that one?
ANAKIN,And those control the pitch?
OBI-WAN,The war's over...No need for it now.
OBI-WAN,A droid control ship.
ANAKIN,Hi! Where have you been?
PADME,Annie! What are you doing here?
ANAKIN,I'm with Qui-Gon...but...they're not going to let me be a Jedi.
PADME,"This is going to be dangerous, Annie."
ANAKIN,Is it? I can help... Where are we going?
PADME,"To war, I'm afraid. The Queen has had to make the most difficuld"
ANAKIN,I want to help...I'm glad you're back.
OBI-WAN,"Jar Jar is on his way to the Gungan city, Master."
OBI-WAN,Do you think the Queen's idea will work?
OBI-WAN,"I'm...I'm sorry for my behavior, Master. It is not my place to"
OBI-WAN,More likely they were wiped out.
PADME,Your Honor...
PADME,I am Queen Amidala (points to Queen) This is my decoy...my
PADME,"(Cont'd) ...I am sorry for my deception, but under the"
PADME,(Cont'd) We are your humble servants...our fate is in your hands.
ANAKIN,All right. They're here!
PADME,What is the situation?
PADME,The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw theDroid Army away
PADME,"(Cont'd) What do you think, Master Jedi?"
PADME,We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We will send
OBI-WAN,"And there's an even bigger danger. If the Vicroy escapes, Your"
PADME,That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything
ANAKIN,Sure.
PADME,Get to your ships!
PADME,My guess is the Viceroy is in the throne room.
ANAKIN,Hey! Wait for me.
ANAKIN,"Oh, no..."
ANAKIN,"(Cont'd) We gotta do something, Artoo."
ANAKIN,"(Cont'd) All right, thanks Artoo! Great idea! I'll take over."
ANAKIN,"(Cont'd) Where's the trigger? Oops, wrong one.. Maybe this one...."
ANAKIN,"(Cont'd) Yeah, all right. ""Droid blaster."" Yeah!"
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) Oops...shield up! Always on the right...shields always on
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) I know we're moving. I'll shut the energy drive down.
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) Oops!! Wrong one.
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) I'm not doing anything!
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) I know...I didn't push anything.
ANAKIN,The Autopilot is searching for what other ships?
ANAKIN,"(Cont'd) There is no manual override, Artoo. You'll have to rewire"
ANAKIN,(cont'd) Look! There they are! That's where the autopilot is
PADME,"We don't have time for this, Captain."
ANAKIN,"Whoo, boy! This is tense!"
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) I've got control?
ANAKIN,"(Cont'd) Okay, let's go left!"
ANAKIN,"(Cont'd) Yes...I've got control. You did it, Artoo!"
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) Go back!?! Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit and
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) Oops! Whoa!
ANAKIN,"(Cont'd) I'll try spinning, that's a good trick."
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) I know we're in trouble! Hang on! The way out of this
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) Which one? This one?
ANAKIN,"I know, Artoo! This isn't Podracing!"
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) We're hit!
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) Great gobs of bantha poo-doo!
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop! Whoa!
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) All right! All right! Get the system started!
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) Everything's overheated. All the lights are red.
PADME,Throw down your weapons. They win this round.
PADME,"Captain, I said throw down your weapons."
PADME,"Now, Viceroy, this is the end of your occupation here."
OBI-WAN,Master! Master!
OBI-WAN,No!
OBI-WAN,"Yes, Master..."
ANAKIN,Uh oh. This is not good.
ANAKIN,"(Cont'd) The systems are still overheated, Artoo."
ANAKIN,Yes...we have ignition.
ANAKIN,Not if I can help it! Shields up!
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) This should stop them.
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) ...and take this!
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) Darn...I missed!
ANAKIN,(Cont'd) Let's get out of here!
ANAKIN,"(Cont'd) Now, this is Podracing! Whoopee!"
ANAKIN,"I'm not going to get into trouble, am I?"
PADME,"Now, Viceroy, you are going to have to go back to the Senate and"
YODA,"Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Coucil does. But agree"
OBI-WAN,Qui-Gon believed in him. I believe in Qui-Gon.
YODA,"The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in"
OBI-WAN,"Master Yoda, Igave Qui-Gon my word. I will train Anakin. Without"
YODA,"Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the"
OBI-WAN,"He is one with the Force, Anakin...You must let go."
ANAKIN,What will happen to me now?
OBI-WAN,"I am your Master now. You will become a Jedi, I promise."
YODA,Always two there are....no more...no less. A maste and an
