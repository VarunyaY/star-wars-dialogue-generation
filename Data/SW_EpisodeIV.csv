THREEPIO,Did you hear that?  They've shut down the main reactor.  We'll be destroyed for sure.  This is madness!
THREEPIO,We're doomed!
THREEPIO,There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.
THREEPIO,What's that?
THREEPIO,I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...
THREEPIO,"Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?"
THREEPIO,At last!  Where have you been?
THREEPIO,They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do?  We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!
THREEPIO,"Wait a minute, where are you going?"
VADER,Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
VADER,If this is a consular ship... where is the Ambassador?
VADER,"Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador.  I want her alive!"
THREEPIO,"Hey, you're not permitted in there.  It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.."
THREEPIO,"Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!  Now come out before somebody sees you."
THREEPIO,Secret mission?  What plans?  What are you talking about?  I'm not getting in there!
THREEPIO,I'm going to regret this.
THREEPIO,"That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here."
THREEPIO,Are you sure this things safe?
LEIA,"Lord Vader, I should have known.  Only you could be so bold.  The Imperial Senate will not sit stillfor this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic..."
VADER,"Don't play games with me, Your Highness.  You weren't on any mercy mission this time.  You passed directly through a restricted system.  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you."
LEIA,I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...
VADER,You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor.  Take her away!
VADER,I have traced the Rebel spies to her.  Now she is my only link to find their secret base!
VADER,Leave that to me.  Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!
VADER,"She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.  Send a detachment down to retrieve them.  See to it personally, Commander.  There'll be no one to stop us this time."
THREEPIO,How did I get into this mess?  I really don't know how.  We seem to be made to suffer.  It's our lot in life.
THREEPIO,I've got to rest before I fall apart.  My joints are almost frozen.
THREEPIO,What a desolate place this is.
THREEPIO,Where are you going?
THREEPIO,"Well, I'm not going that way.  It's much too rocky.  This way is much easier."
THREEPIO,What makes you think there are settlements over there?
THREEPIO,Don't get technical with me.
THREEPIO,"What mission?  What are you talking about?  I've had just about enough of you!  Go that way!  You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!"
THREEPIO,"And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it."
THREEPIO,No more adventures.  I'm not going that way.
THREEPIO,"That malfunctioning little twerp.  This is all his fault!  He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better."
THREEPIO,"Wait, what's that?  A transport!  I'm saved!"
THREEPIO,"Over here!  Help!  Please, help!"
THREEPIO,Artoo-Detoo!  It's you!  It's you!
THREEPIO,Wake up!  Wake up!
THREEPIO,We're doomed.
THREEPIO,Do you think they'll melt us down?
THREEPIO,Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  Will this never end?
THREEPIO,Sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...
THREEPIO,Vaporators!  Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators.  You could say...
THREEPIO,"Of course I can, sir.  It's like a second language for me...  I'm as fluent in Bocce..."
THREEPIO,"Shutting up, sir."
THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.  A real bargain."
THREEPIO,"Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.  He really is in first-class condition.  I've worked with him before.  Here he comes."
THREEPIO,"Now, don't forget this!  Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!"
THREEPIO,"Thank the maker!  This oil bath is going to feel so good.  I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!"
THREEPIO,Is there anything I might do to help?
THREEPIO,"I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on."
THREEPIO,"I see, sir."
THREEPIO,"I see, sir Luke."
THREEPIO,"And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo."
THREEPIO,"With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all."
THREEPIO,"That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir."
THREEPIO,"Several, I think.  Actually, there's not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories.  Well, not at making them interesting, anyways."
LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You'remy only hope."
THREEPIO,What is what?!?  He asked you a question...What is that?
LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope."
THREEPIO,"Oh, he says it's nothing, sir.  Merely a malfunction.  Old data.  Pay it no mind."
THREEPIO,"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir."
LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi..."
THREEPIO,"I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance, sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to..."
THREEPIO,"Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble.  It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master."
THREEPIO,"He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric."
THREEPIO,"I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?"
THREEPIO,"He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording."
THREEPIO,been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!
THREEPIO,"I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter."
THREEPIO,Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
THREEPIO,"No, I don't think he likes you at all."
THREEPIO,"No, I don't like you either."
THREEPIO,"It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission."
THREEPIO,That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I can't understand their logic at times.
THREEPIO,"Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?"
THREEPIO,"Oh, he excels at that, sir."
THREEPIO,"Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault."
THREEPIO,"Deactivate!  Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt..."
THREEPIO,"Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either.  You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here."
THREEPIO,"If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop."
THREEPIO,"Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast."
BEN,Hello there!  Come here my little friend.  Don't be afraid.
BEN,"Don't worry, he'll be all right."
BEN,"Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.  You're fortunate you're still in one piece."
BEN,"The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?"
BEN,Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan?  Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.
BEN,"Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet."
BEN,"Well of course, of course I know him.  He's me!  I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born."
BEN,Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.  Very interesting...
BEN,I think we better get indoors.  The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.
THREEPIO,Where am I?  I must have taken a bad step...
THREEPIO,"I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for."
BEN,"Quickly, son... they're on the move."
BEN,That's what your uncle told you.  He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
BEN,"Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father."
BEN,"He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.  I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me..."
BEN,"I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did."
THREEPIO,"Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile."
BEN,Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.  Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.
BEN,"An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire."
BEN,"A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force."
BEN,"Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things.  It surrounds us and penetrates us.  It binds the galaxy together."
BEN,"Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend.  And where you come from."
BEN,I seem to have found it.
LEIA,"General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope."
BEN,You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
BEN,"I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.She needs your help."
BEN,That's your uncle talking.
BEN,"Learn about the Force, Luke."
BEN,"You must do what you feel is right, of course."
VADER,The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
VADER,Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.  The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
VADER,I find your lack of faith disturbing.
VADER,As you wish.
BEN,They didn't.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.
BEN,"And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People.  Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise."
BEN,"Wait, Luke!  It's too dangerous."
VADER,"And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base."
BEN,"There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there.  You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire."
BEN,Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.
BEN,They're for sale if you want them.
BEN,You don't need to see his identification.
BEN,looking for.
BEN,He can go about his business.
BEN,Move along.
THREEPIO,I can't abide these Jawas.  Disgusting creatures.
BEN,The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.  You will find it a powerful ally.
BEN,"Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.  Only watch your step.  This place can be a little rough."
THREEPIO,"Come along, Artoo."
THREEPIO,I heartily agree with you sir.
BEN,This little one isn't worth the effort.  Come let me buy you something...
BEN,This is Chewbacca.  He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.
THREEPIO,I don't like the look of this.
HAN,Han Solo.  I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
BEN,"Yes, indeed.  If it's a fast ship."
HAN,Fast ship?  You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
BEN,Should I have?
HAN,It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!
HAN,"I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.  She's fast enough for you, old man.  What's the cargo?"
BEN,"Only passengers.  Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked."
HAN,What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?
BEN,Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.
HAN,"Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance."
HAN,"But who's going to fly it, kid!  You?"
BEN,"We haven't that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan."
HAN,"Seventeen, huh!"
HAN,Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  We'll leave as soon as you're ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.
BEN,Ninety-four.
HAN,Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
HAN,Seventeen thousand!  Those guys must really be desperate.  This could really save my neck.  Get back to the ship and get her ready.
BEN,You'll have to sell your speeder.
HAN,"Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.  Tell Jabba that I've got his money."
HAN,"Yeah, but this time I got the money."
HAN,I don't have it with me.  Tell Jabba...
HAN,Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?
HAN,Over my dead body.
HAN,"Yes, I'll bet you have."
HAN,Sorry about the mess.
VADER,Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.  It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.
VADER,What do you mean?
THREEPIO,"Lock the door, Artoo."
THREEPIO,"I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault."
THREEPIO,You watch your language!
BEN,It will be enough.
BEN,"If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well."
JABBA,"Come on out, Solo!"
HAN,"I've been waiting for you, Jabba."
JABBA,I expected you would be.
HAN,I'm not the type to run.
JABBA,"Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me?  And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together."
HAN,You sent Greedo to blast me.
JABBA,"Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business.  You're too valuable to fry.  He was only relaying my concern at your delays.  He wasn't going to blast you."
HAN,"I think he thought he was.  Next time don't send one of those twerps.  If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself."
JABBA,"Han, Han!  If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  It's not good business."
HAN,"You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.  I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.  I just need some more time."
JABBA,"Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life."
HAN,"Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure."
HAN,"She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.  She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.  I've added some special modifications myself."
HAN,"We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here."
THREEPIO,"Hello, sir."
HAN,"Chewie, get us out of here!"
THREEPIO,"Oh, my.  I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel."
HAN,It looks like an Imperial cruiser.  Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.  Try and hold them off.  Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.
HAN,Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.
HAN,"Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!"
HAN,Here's where the fun begins!
BEN,How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
HAN,It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.
HAN,"Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?"
HAN,"We're losing our deflector shield.  Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed."
LEIA,"Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.  I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board."
LEIA,to take the responsibility yourself!
LEIA,"The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers."
LEIA,No!  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons.  You can't possibly...
LEIA,Dantooine.
LEIA,They're on Dantooine.
LEIA,What?
LEIA,No!
VADER,Commence primary ignition.
BEN,I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened.
BEN,You'd better get on with your exercises.
HAN,"Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em."
HAN,Don't everyone thank me at once.
HAN,"Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours."
THREEPIO,"Now be careful, Artoo."
THREEPIO,He made a fair move.  Screaming about it won't help you.
HAN,Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
THREEPIO,"But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid."
HAN,That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.
THREEPIO,"I see your point, sir.  I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win."
BEN,"Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him."
BEN,Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
HAN,"Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid."
HAN,"Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.  There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny."
HAN,It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
BEN,"I suggest you try it again, Luke."
BEN,"This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct."
BEN,Your eyes can deceive you.  Don't trust them.
BEN,Stretch out with your feelings.
BEN,"You see, you can do it."
HAN,I call it luck.
BEN,"In my experience, there's no such thing as luck."
HAN,"Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else."
HAN,Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
BEN,That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.
VADER,I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.
HAN,"Stand by, Chewie, here we go.  Cut in the sublight engines."
HAN,"What the...?  Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.  Some kind of asteroid collision.  It's not on any of the charts."
HAN,"Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!"
HAN,"Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.  It ain't there.  It's been totally blown away."
BEN,Destroyed... by the Empire!
HAN,The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...
HAN,There's another ship coming in.
BEN,It's an Imperial fighter.
BEN,No.  It's a short range fighter.
HAN,There aren't any bases around here.  Where did it come from?
HAN,Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam it's transmissions.
BEN,It'd be as well to let it go.  It's too far out of range.
HAN,Not for long...
BEN,A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
HAN,"Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us."
HAN,I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.
BEN,That's no moon!  It's a space station.
HAN,It's too big to be a space station.
BEN,Turn the ship around!
HAN,"Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power."
HAN,We're caught in a tractor beam!  It's pulling us in!
HAN,"There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.  I'm in full power.  I'm going to have to shut down.  But they're not going to get me without a fight!"
BEN,You can't win.  But there are alternatives to fighting.
VADER,They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.  She may yet be of some use to us.
VADER,Did you find any droids?
VADER,Send a scanning crew on board.  I want every part of this ship checked.
VADER,I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...
HAN,"I use them for smuggling.  I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them.  This is ridiculous.  Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam."
BEN,Leave that to me!
HAN,Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!
BEN,Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?
HAN,"Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?"
HAN,Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
THREEPIO,"We found the computer outlet, sir."
BEN,Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.
THREEPIO,He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here.  He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.
THREEPIO,The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.  A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
BEN,I don't think you boys can help.  I must go alone.
HAN,Whatever you say.  I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.
BEN,"Be patient, Luke.  Stay and watch over the droids."
BEN,They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.  Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.  The Force will be with you... always!
HAN,"Boy you said it, Chewie."
HAN,Where did you dig up that old fossil?
HAN,"Yeah, great at getting us into trouble."
HAN,"Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up..."
THREEPIO,"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says \I found her,\ and keepsrepeating, \She's here.\"
THREEPIO,Princess Leia.
HAN,Princess?
HAN,Princess?  What's going on?
THREEPIO,Level five. Detention block AA-twenty-three.  I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
HAN,What are you talking about?
HAN,"Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here."
HAN,I'm not going anywhere.
HAN,Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
HAN,Better her than me...
HAN,Rich?
HAN,What?
HAN,"I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!"
HAN,I better!
HAN,"All right, kid.  But you'd better be right about this!"
HAN,What's your plan?
HAN,"Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind."
THREEPIO,"Master Luke, sir!  Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?"
HAN,And hope they don't have blasters.
THREEPIO,That isn't very reassuring.
HAN,This is not going to work.
HAN,I did say so before!
HAN,Look out!  He's loose!
HAN,Go get him!
HAN,We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.  Here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven.  You go get her.  I'll hold them here.
HAN,Everything is under control.  Situation normal.
HAN,"Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.  But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.  We're fine.  We're all fine here, now, thank you.  How are you?"
HAN,"Uh, uh, negative, negative.  We had a reactor leak here now.  Give us a few minutes to lock it down.  Large leak... very dangerous."
HAN,Boring conversation anyway.Luke!  We're going to have company!
LEIA,Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?
LEIA,You're who?
LEIA,Ben Kenobi is here!  Where is he?
VADER,He is here...
VADER,A tremor in the Force.  The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
VADER,Don't underestimate the Force.
VADER,Obi-Wan is here.  The Force is with him.
VADER,Escape may not his plan.  I must face him alone.
HAN,Chewie!
HAN,Get behind me!  Get behind me!
HAN,Can't get out that way.
LEIA,Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
HAN,"Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness."
THREEPIO,Yes sir?
THREEPIO,"I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.  The main entrance seems to be the only way out; all other information on your level is restricted."
THREEPIO,"Oh, no!"
HAN,I can't hold them off forever!  Now what?
LEIA,"This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?"
HAN,"He's the brains, sweetheart."
HAN,What the hell are you doing?
LEIA,"Somebody has to save our skins.  Into the garbage chute, wise guy."
HAN,Get in there you big furry oaf!  I don't care what you smell!  Get in there and don't worry about it.
HAN,Wonderful girl!  Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.  Get in there!
HAN,Oh!  The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.  What an incredible smell you've discovered!  Let's get out of here!  Get away from there...
LEIA,Put that thing away!  You're going to get us all killed.
HAN,"Absolutely, Your Worship.  Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.  You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us."
LEIA,It could be worse...
HAN,It's worse.
HAN,That's your imagination.
HAN,What?
HAN,Luke!  Luke!  Luke!
LEIA,Luke!
LEIA,"Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this."
HAN,Where?
HAN,Luke!  Luke!
LEIA,Grab him!
LEIA,What happened?
HAN,I've got a very bad feeling about this.
LEIA,Don't just stand there.  Try and brace it with something.
THREEPIO,"They're madmen!  They're heading for the prison level.  If you hurry, you might catch them."
THREEPIO,Come on!
THREEPIO,"Oh!  All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here.  If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance."
HAN,Get to the top!
LEIA,I can't
THREEPIO,They aren't here!  Something must have happened to them.  See if they've been captured.
THREEPIO,Hurry!
HAN,One thing's for sure.  We're all going to be a lot thinner!Get on top of it!
LEIA,I'm trying!
THREEPIO,"Thank goodness, they haven't found them!  Where could they be?"
THREEPIO,"Use the comlink?  Oh, my!  I forgot I turned it off!"
THREEPIO,"Are you there, sir?"
THREEPIO,We've had some problems...
THREEPIO,No.  Shut them all down!  Hurry!
THREEPIO,"Listen to them!  They're dying, Artoo!  Curse my metal body!  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault!  My poor master!"
HAN,Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.
HAN,"If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here."
HAN,Where are you going?
LEIA,"No, wait.  They'll hear!"
HAN,"Come here, you big coward!"
HAN,Chewie!  Come here!
LEIA,"Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you.  Okay?"
HAN,"Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight!  I takeorders from one person!  Me!"
LEIA,It's a wonder you're still alive.Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
HAN,No reward is worth this.
HAN,There she is.
THREEPIO,"For the moment.  Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship."
LEIA,You came in that thing?  You're braver that I thought.
HAN,Nice!  Come on!
HAN,Get back to the ship!
LEIA,He certainly has courage.
LEIA,There's no lock!
LEIA,"Quick, we've got to get across.  Find the control that extends the bridge."
LEIA,They're coming through!
LEIA,Here they come!
LEIA,For luck!
THREEPIO,Where could they be?
VADER,"I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.  We meet again, at last.  The circle is now complete."
VADER,"When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master."
BEN,"Only a master of evil, Darth."
VADER,"Your powers are weak, old man."
BEN,"You can't win, Darth.  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine."
HAN,Didn't we just leave this party?
HAN,What kept you?
LEIA,We ran into some old friends.
HAN,"Seems okay, if we can get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission."
THREEPIO,"Come on, Artoo, we're going!"
HAN,Now's our chance!  Go!
HAN,Come on!
LEIA,"Come on!  Luke, its too late!"
HAN,Blast the door!  Kid!
BEN,"Run, Luke!  Run!"
HAN,"I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip.  Okay, hit it!"
HAN,We're coming up on the sentry ships.  Hold 'em off!  Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns!
LEIA,There wasn't anything you could have done.
HAN,"Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!"
HAN,"You in, kid?  Okay, stay sharp!"
LEIA,Here they come!
THREEPIO,Oooh!
LEIA,We've lost lateral controls.
HAN,"Don't worry, she'll hold together."
HAN,"You hear me, baby?  Hold together!"
HAN,Great kid!  Don't get cocky.
LEIA,There are still two more of them out there!
LEIA,We did it!
THREEPIO,Help!  I think I'm melting!This is all your fault.
VADER,They have just made the jump into hyperspace.
HAN,"Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?  You know, sometimes I even amaze myself."
LEIA,"That doesn't sound too hard.  Besides, they let us go.  It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape."
HAN,Easy... you call that easy?
LEIA,Their tracking us!
HAN,"Not this ship, sister."
LEIA,At least the information in Artoo is still intact.
HAN,What's so important?  What's he carrying?
LEIA,"The technical readouts of that battle station.  I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found.  It's not over yet!"
HAN,"It is for me, sister!  Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.  I expect to be well paid.  I'm in it for the money!"
LEIA,"You needn't worry about your reward.  If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!"
LEIA,Your friend is quite a mercenary.  I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.
HAN,"I'm trying not to, kid!"
HAN,"Still, she's got a lot of spirit.  I don't know, what do you think?  Do you think a princess and a guy like me..."
LEIA,"We don't have time for our sorrows, commander.  The battle station has surely tracked us here.It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.  You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack.  It is our only hope."
VADER,This will be a day long remembered.  It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.
HAN,"That's right, yeah!  I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.  Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you?  Why don't you come with us?  You're pretty good in a fight.  I could use you."
HAN,"What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain'tmy idea of courage.  It's more like suicide."
HAN,"Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!"
HAN,What're you lookin' at?  I know what I'm doing.
LEIA,What's wrong?
LEIA,He's got to follow his own path.  No one can choose it for him.
THREEPIO,"Hang on tight, Artoo, you've got to come back."
THREEPIO,"You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?"
BEN,"Luke, the Force will be with you."
VADER,We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.  Get the crews to their fighters.
VADER,Several fighters have broken off from the main group.  Come with me!
VADER,Stay in attack formation!
VADER,I'll take them myself!  Cover me!
VADER,Close up formation.
VADER,Let him go!  Stay on the leader!
VADER,I'm on the leader.
THREEPIO,"Hang on, Artoo!"
BEN,"Use the Force, Luke."
BEN,"Let go, Luke."
VADER,The Force is strong with this one!
BEN,"Luke, trust me."
VADER,I have you now.
VADER,What?
HAN,Yahoo!
HAN,"You're all clear, kid."
HAN,Now let's blow this thing and go home!
HAN,"Great shot, kid.  That was one in a million."
BEN,"Remember, the Force will be with you... always."
LEIA,Luke!  Luke!  Luke!
HAN,Hey!  Hey!
HAN,"Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward."
LEIA,"Hey, I knew there was more to you than money."
THREEPIO,"Oh, my!  Artoo!  Can you hear me?  Say something!You can repair him, can't you?"
THREEPIO,"You must repair him!  Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them."
