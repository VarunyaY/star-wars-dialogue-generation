character,dialogue
ANAKIN,"There isn't a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor . . ."
OBI-WAN,"Look out, four droids inbound . . ."
OBI-WAN,We've got to split them up.
ANAKIN,"Break left, fly through the guns on that tower."
OBI-WAN,Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait?
ANAKIN,Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.
OBI-WAN,"Anakin, they're all over me!"
ANAKIN,"Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . ."
ANAKIN,"(continuing, laughs) We got him, Artoo!"
ANAKIN,"I copy, Artoo."
OBI-WAN,I'm going down on the deck.
ANAKIN,Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver.
ANAKIN,"(continuing) Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!"
OBI-WAN,Hurry up! I don't like this!
OBI-WAN,(continuing) Ouch!
OBI-WAN,"(continuing) Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've shut it down."
ANAKIN,We're locked on ... we've got him . . .
ANAKIN,"(continuing) Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo."
OBI-WAN,Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find the Command Ship and get on with it ...
ANAKIN,"Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead."
ANAKIN,(continuing) The one crawling with vulture droids.
OBI-WAN,"I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy."
ANAKIN,"Come on, Master."
OBI-WAN,"Not this time. There's too much at stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do you copy?"
OBI-WAN,Mark my position and form your squad up behind me . . .
ANAKIN,"This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, coming down the left side."
OBI-WAN,Add five Tri-fighters on the right . . .
ANAKIN,I'm going head to head. See you.
OBI-WAN,"Take it easy, Anakin."
ANAKIN,Incoming!!
OBI-WAN,Five more on the right!
ANAKIN,Here we go.
OBI-WAN,I'm going high and right.
ANAKIN,Hang on. There are four more of them.
OBI-WAN,Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let them pass between us.
ANAKIN,I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail.
OBI-WAN,"All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash."
ANAKIN,How many back there. Artoo? (Artoo beeps) Three . . . (continuing) Four . . . that's not good.
OBI-WAN,"Anakin, you have four on your tail."
ANAKIN,I know. I know!
OBI-WAN,Four more closing from your left.
ANAKIN,I know. I know!
OBI-WAN,Break right and go high.
ANAKIN,I'm going low and left.
OBI-WAN,(to himself) He still has much to learn.
ANAKIN,"Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the needle . . ."
OBI-WAN,Too dangerous. First Jedi rule
ANAKIN,"Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little."
OBI-WAN,Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left.
OBI-WAN,"(continuing) You'll never get through there, Anakin. It's too tight."
ANAKIN,"Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before."
OBI-WAN,"Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow."
ANAKIN,"Wrong thought, Artoo."
ANAKIN,(continuing) I'm through.
ANAKIN,I'm going to go help them out!
OBI-WAN,"No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship!"
ANAKIN,Missiles! Pull up!
OBI-WAN,They overshot us . . .
ANAKIN,They're coming around!
OBI-WAN,"All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy."
ANAKIN,Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters.
ANAKIN,We got 'em. Artoo!
OBI-WAN,Flying is for droids.
OBI-WAN,(continuing) I'm hit! Anakin?
ANAKIN,I see them . . . Buzz Droids.
OBI-WAN,"Arfour, be careful. You have one . . ."
OBI-WAN,Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls.
ANAKIN,Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.
OBI-WAN,The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here.
OBI-WAN,(continuing) In the name of ...
ANAKIN,Steady . . . steady . . .
OBI-WAN,"Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here."
ANAKIN,"I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . ."
OBI-WAN,"Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, Anakin."
ANAKIN,Move to the right.
OBI-WAN,"Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do."
ANAKIN,"I'm not leaving without you, Master."
OBI-WAN,Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone.
ANAKIN,"Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out!"
OBI-WAN,"Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye."
ANAKIN,"Yeah, you got him!"
OBI-WAN,"Great, Artoo."
ANAKIN,Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar.
OBI-WAN,Have you noticed the shields are still up?
ANAKIN,"Oh?!? Sorry, Master."
OBI-WAN,"Oh, I have a bad feeling about this."
OBI-WAN,"Artoo, locate the Chancellor."
ANAKIN,Tap into the ship's computers.
OBI-WAN,The Chancellor's signal is coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire.
ANAKIN,I sense Count Dooku . . .
OBI-WAN,I sense a trap.
ANAKIN,Next move?
OBI-WAN,Spring the trap.
ANAKIN,"Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship."
OBI-WAN,"Here, take this, and wait for orders."
OBI-WAN,"We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him."
OBI-WAN,Anakin. . .
ANAKIN,Ready.
OBI-WAN,. . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That's why they've stopped shooting.
ANAKIN,"Well then, we're safe for the time being."
OBI-WAN,Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.
ANAKIN,They're sealing this section off.
OBI-WAN,Six droids coming our way!
ANAKIN,Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.
OBI-WAN,We'll never get through that. It's too small!
ANAKIN,I found our escape vent.
OBI-WAN,"Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here."
ANAKIN,"Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . ."
ANAKIN,Here's a way out.
OBI-WAN,That won't hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers.
ANAKIN,The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized.
OBI-WAN,"You still have much to learn, Anakin."
OBI-WAN,"All right, you win. I have much to learn. Let's go!"
ANAKIN,Destroyers!!
OBI-WAN,Did you press the stop button?
ANAKIN,"No, did you?"
OBI-WAN,No!
ANAKIN,"Well, there's more than one way out of here."
OBI-WAN,"We don't want to get out, we want to get moving. Artoo . . . Artoo. Do you copy? Activate elevator . . . (looks at control panel) . . . 31174 . . ."
OBI-WAN,Artoo?
OBI-WAN,(continuing) Always on the move.
OBI-WAN,"(OS) Artoo, switch on the comlink. Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we gave you a job to do! Artoo."
OBI-WAN,"Stop, stop! Artoo, we need to be going up."
OBI-WAN,"(OS) Artoo, do you copy? Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we need to be going up, not down."
OBI-WAN,"Stop. Artoo! We need to go up! Stop, stop!"
OBI-WAN,"Now, that's better . . ."
OBI-WAN,"Oh, it's you . . ."
ANAKIN,What was that all about?
OBI-WAN,"Well, Artoo has been . . ."
ANAKIN,No loose wire jokes . . . He's doing the best he can.
OBI-WAN,Did I say anything?
ANAKIN,He's trying!
OBI-WAN,I didn't say anything!
OBI-WAN,(bows) Chancellor.
ANAKIN,Are you all right?
OBI-WAN,(quietly to Anakin) This time we will do it together.
ANAKIN,I was about to say that.
OBI-WAN,"Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty."
OBI-WAN,"You won't get away this time, Dooku."
ANAKIN,"My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count."
ANAKIN,I shouldn't . . .
ANAKIN,... I couldn't stop myself.
ANAKIN,"Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner."
ANAKIN,"(continuing) I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way."
ANAKIN,"He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right."
ANAKIN,His fate will be the same as ours.
ANAKIN,"The elevator's not working, (into his comlink) Artoo . . ."
ANAKIN,(continuing) . . . Activate Elevator 3224.
ANAKIN,"(continuing) Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in!"
ANAKIN,"We can't wait. Come on, we have to be fast."
ANAKIN,Easy. . . . We're in a bit of a situation.
OBI-WAN,Did I miss something?
OBI-WAN,What is that?
OBI-WAN,(continuing) Oops.
ANAKIN,"Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!"
OBI-WAN,Too late! Jump!
OBI-WAN,Let's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that's still flyable. Come on.
ANAKIN,"Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy?"
OBI-WAN,None of those ships will get us anywhere.
ANAKIN,I agree.
ANAKIN,I don't know.
OBI-WAN,Don't look at me. I don't know.
ANAKIN,"Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on."
OBI-WAN,We'll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod.
ANAKIN,Ray shields!
OBI-WAN,"Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this."
ANAKIN,"Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted."
OBI-WAN,"Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault."
ANAKIN,You're the Master. I'm just a hero.
OBI-WAN,I'm open to suggestions here.
ANAKIN,I say . . . patience.
OBI-WAN,"Patience! That's your plan, is it?"
ANAKIN,"Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . ."
ANAKIN,(continuing) See! No problem.
OBI-WAN,Do you have a plan B?
OBI-WAN,That depends upon your point of view. Hah!
ANAKIN,General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected.
OBI-WAN,"Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do."
OBI-WAN,Not this time. And this time you won't escape.
ANAKIN,Artoo.
ANAKIN,All the escape pods have been launched.
OBI-WAN,Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?
ANAKIN,"You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?"
OBI-WAN,Well?
ANAKIN,"Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in."
OBI-WAN,Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.
ANAKIN,"Pressure rising. We've got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins."
OBI-WAN,"Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins . . ."
ANAKIN,We lost something.
OBI-WAN,"Not to worry, we're still flying half the ship."
ANAKIN,Now we're really picking up speed . . . I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.
OBI-WAN,Careful . . . we're heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .
ANAKIN,What's our speed?
OBI-WAN,"Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand, nine thousand . . . we're in the atmosphere . . ."
ANAKIN,Grab that . . . Keep us level.
OBI-WAN,Steady. Steady.
ANAKIN,"Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields."
OBI-WAN,Five thousand. Three thousand . . . two thousand. Fireships on the left and the right.
OBI-WAN,Copy that. Landing strip's straight ahead.
ANAKIN,We're coming in too hot.
OBI-WAN,Easy-easy.
OBI-WAN,Another happy landing.
ANAKIN,"(to Obi-Wan) Are you coming, Master?"
OBI-WAN,"Oh no. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy."
ANAKIN,"Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time."
OBI-WAN,"Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . ."
ANAKIN,"All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness."
OBI-WAN,". . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians."
ANAKIN,All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .
OBI-WAN,Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing.
ANAKIN,"Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of."
C-3PO,It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.
C-3PO,"(continuing) Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself."
ANAKIN,"I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that."
ANAKIN,Excuse me.
PADME,"Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back."
ANAKIN,"I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so."
PADME,There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread.
ANAKIN,"I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges."
PADME,"Wait, not here . . ."
ANAKIN,"Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married."
PADME,"Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . ."
ANAKIN,"I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you."
PADME,"(playfully) I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later."
ANAKIN,Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?
PADME,I'm just excited to see you.
ANAKIN,That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?
PADME,Nothing . . . nothing . . .
ANAKIN,You're frightened. (a little angry) Tell me what's going on!
PADME,You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . .
ANAKIN,. . . Is there someone else?
PADME,"(peeved, angry) No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed."
ANAKIN,"(sheepish) I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all."
PADME,"I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you."
ANAKIN,It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .
PADME,Something wonderful has happened.
PADME,"(continuing) I'm . . . Annie, I'm pregnant."
ANAKIN,That's . . . that's wonderful.
PADME,What are we going to do?
ANAKIN,"We're not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life."
ANAKIN,". . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this moment."
PADME,"Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens."
ANAKIN,You are so beautiful!
PADME,It's only because I'm so in love . . .
ANAKIN,"No, it's because I'm so in love with you."
PADME,So love has blinded you?
ANAKIN,"Well, that's not exactly what I meant . . ."
PADME,But it's probably true!
ANAKIN,I haven't laughed in so long . . .
PADME,Neither have I.
PADME,"Anakin, help me! Help, Anakin! Anakin, I love you. I love you."
PADME,Anakin??
PADME,What's bothering you?
ANAKIN,Nothing . . .
ANAKIN,(continuing) I remember when I gave this to you.
PADME,"Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?"
ANAKIN,It was a dream.
PADME,Bad?
ANAKIN,Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.
PADME,And?
ANAKIN,It was about you.
PADME,Tell me.
ANAKIN,It was only a dream.
ANAKIN,(continuing) You die in childbirth . . .
PADME,And the baby?
ANAKIN,I don't know.
PADME,It was only a dream.
ANAKIN,". . . I won't let this one become real, Padme."
PADME,"Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order."
ANAKIN,I know .
PADME,"Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?"
ANAKIN,(suspicious) Have you told him anything?
PADME,"No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something."
ANAKIN,"He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything!"
PADME,"I won't, Anakin."
ANAKIN,"I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem."
YODA,Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .
ANAKIN,"They are of pain, suffering, death . . ."
YODA,"Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?"
ANAKIN,Someone . . .
YODA,. . . close to you?
ANAKIN,Yes.
YODA,"Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side."
ANAKIN,"I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda."
YODA,"Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is."
ANAKIN,"What must I do, Master Yoda?"
YODA,Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
OBI-WAN,You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.
ANAKIN,"I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse."
OBI-WAN,"In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity."
ANAKIN,What's wrong then?
OBI-WAN,The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.
ANAKIN,"Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war."
OBI-WAN,"Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine."
ANAKIN,Be careful of what?
OBI-WAN,He has requested your presence.
ANAKIN,What for?
OBI-WAN,He would not say.
ANAKIN,"He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual, isn't it?"
OBI-WAN,"All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy. You're probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed."
ANAKIN,"I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power, mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?"
OBI-WAN,"The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we are all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings."
ANAKIN,The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?
ANAKIN,"I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way."
ANAKIN,"With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments."
ANAKIN,Everyone will agree on that.
ANAKIN,Of course.
ANAKIN,What do you mean?
ANAKIN,"I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir."
ANAKIN,For what? I don't understand.
ANAKIN,"Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this."
PADME,Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?
PADME,I can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.
PADME,"Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point, it's better to leave some things unsaid."
PADME,Agreed.
ANAKIN,I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.
YODA,"Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine."
ANAKIN,I understand.
ANAKIN,"What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?"
ANAKIN,"Forgive me, Master."
YODA,"Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep."
OBI-WAN,It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.
OBI-WAN,"And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup."
YODA,"Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait."
OBI-WAN,"He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant."
ANAKIN,I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.
YODA,"Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have."
ANAKIN,"What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting!"
OBI-WAN,"Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs."
ANAKIN,"I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . ."
OBI-WAN,But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.
ANAKIN,That has nothing to do with this.
OBI-WAN,"Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation."
ANAKIN,You mean divided loyalties.
OBI-WAN,I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it.
ANAKIN,The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.
OBI-WAN,"No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous, dark thoughts."
ANAKIN,"Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie."
OBI-WAN,I hope so . . .
ANAKIN,I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying.
OBI-WAN,"Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you."
ANAKIN,And?
OBI-WAN,"Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation."
ANAKIN,What situation?
OBI-WAN,(takes a deep breath) The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.
ANAKIN,They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!
OBI-WAN,"We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not."
ANAKIN,Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?
OBI-WAN,This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.
ANAKIN,"The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here."
OBI-WAN,"That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired."
ANAKIN,"Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer."
OBI-WAN,"Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place."
ANAKIN,You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?
OBI-WAN,The Council is asking you.
OBI-WAN,Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.
YODA,"Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers."
OBI-WAN,He'll be all right. I trust him with my life.
OBI-WAN,"With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?"
YODA,A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.
OBI-WAN,He will not let me down. He never has.
YODA,"I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you."
PADME,"Thank you, Captain."
PADME,I'll be up in a while.
C-3PO,"Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?"
PADME,"Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio."
ANAKIN,"Beautiful, isn't it?"
PADME,You startled me.
ANAKIN,How are you feeling?
PADME,He keeps kicking.
ANAKIN,He?! Why do you think it's a boy?
PADME,(laughs) My motherly intuition.
ANAKIN,"Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl."
PADME,I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.
ANAKIN,"I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master."
PADME,"Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills."
ANAKIN,"They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem."
PADME,Anakin . . .
ANAKIN,"Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic."
PADME,Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?
ANAKIN,(suspicious) What do you mean?
PADME,"What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?"
ANAKIN,I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!
PADME,"Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume."
ANAKIN,"(growing angry) Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!"
PADME,What is it?
ANAKIN,Nothing.
PADME,Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.
ANAKIN,You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you.
ANAKIN,(continuing) I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.
PADME,I sense there are things you are not telling me.
PADME,"(continuing) Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war."
ANAKIN,"You wanted to see me, Chancellor."
ANAKIN,"At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war."
ANAKIN,They try.
ANAKIN,I'm not sure I understand.
ANAKIN,I don't think . . .
ANAKIN,I know they don't trust you . . .
ANAKIN,I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.
ANAKIN,I don't know ... I don't know what to say.
ANAKIN,The Jedi use their power for good.
ANAKIN,. . . evil.
ANAKIN,"The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves."
ANAKIN,The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.
ANAKIN,I'm not sure it's wrong.
ANAKIN,No.
ANAKIN,He could actually save people from death?
ANAKIN,What happened to him?
ANAKIN,Is it possible to learn this power?
ANAKIN,A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.
YODA,"Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed."
OBI-WAN,Does everyone agree?
ANAKIN,The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.
YODA,"A Master is needed, with more experience."
ANAKIN,He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.
ANAKIN,"(continuing) No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact."
OBI-WAN,"Oh no, you're quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat."
YODA,"Obi-Wan, my choice is."
YODA,I agree.
YODA,"Then now the time is, Commander."
OBI-WAN,Has Anakin been to see you?
PADME,Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.
OBI-WAN,"I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted."
PADME,"You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it?"
OBI-WAN,"You should be a Jedi, Padme."
PADME,You're not very good at hiding your feelings.
OBI-WAN,It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.
PADME,Why would he talk to me about his work?
OBI-WAN,Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.
PADME,Don't give me that look.
OBI-WAN,I know how he feels about you.
PADME,(nervous) What did he say?
OBI-WAN,Nothing. He didn't have to.
PADME,I don't know what you're talking about.
OBI-WAN,"I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I'm worried about him."
OBI-WAN,(continuing) I fear your relationship has confused him. He's changed considerably since we returned . . .
OBI-WAN,"(continuing) Padme, I'm not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn't upset you. We're all friends, I care about both of you . . ."
PADME,"Thank you, Obi-Wan."
OBI-WAN,Please do what you can to help him.
PADME,We cannot let this turn into another war.
PADME,I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.
PADME,I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.
PADME,The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . .
ANAKIN,"You're going to need me on this one, Master."
OBI-WAN,"Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase."
ANAKIN,Master!
ANAKIN,"(continuing) Master, I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me."
OBI-WAN,"You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master."
OBI-WAN,(continuing) Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.
ANAKIN,"Well, there's always a first time."
ANAKIN,"Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you."
OBI-WAN,"Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you."
OBI-WAN,I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long.
OBI-WAN,(laughing) Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.
OBI-WAN,"Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there."
ANAKIN,He will soon have Grievous's head.
ANAKIN,The Council was very sure in its decision.
ANAKIN,"Hi, Jar Jar."
ANAKIN,Not fit? Why would anyone think that?
ANAKIN,That's ridiculous. Who?!?
ANAKIN,That's impossible. I would know.
OBI-WAN,Save your energy.
PADME,I can't!
OBI-WAN,"Don't give up, Padme. Don't give up . . ."
ANAKIN,"I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?"
PADME,He came by this morning.
ANAKIN,What did he want?
PADME,He's worried about you.
ANAKIN,"You told him about us, didn't you?"
PADME,"He's your best friend, Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress."
ANAKIN,And he's not?
PADME,You have been moody lately.
ANAKIN,I'm not moody . . .
PADME,Anakin! Don't do this again.
ANAKIN,I don't know ... I feel . . . lost.
PADME,Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand.
ANAKIN,Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.
PADME,They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.
ANAKIN,"Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn't."
PADME,You expect too much of yourself.
ANAKIN,I have found a way to save you.
PADME,Save me?
ANAKIN,From my nightmares.
PADME,Is that what's bothering you?
ANAKIN,"I won't lose you, Padme."
PADME,"I'm not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you."
ANAKIN,"No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying."
PADME,"You don't need more power, Anakin. I believe you can protect me against anything, just as you are."
OBI-WAN,"Unfortunately, the war."
OBI-WAN,"With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous."
OBI-WAN,I understand.
OBI-WAN,"Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time."
OBI-WAN,"(continuing) Geenine, take the Fighter back to the ship. I'm staying here. Tell Cody I've made contact."
OBI-WAN,I need transportation.
OBI-WAN,Get it for me.
OBI-WAN,This one.
OBI-WAN,"Good girl, Boga."
OBI-WAN,"Hello, there!"
OBI-WAN,Your move.
OBI-WAN,You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku!
OBI-WAN,"I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will."
OBI-WAN,I don't think so.
PADME,"May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution?"
PADME,"You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then."
PADME,"On behalf of the ""delegation of two thousand,"" I thank you, Chancellor."
ANAKIN,What do you mean?
ANAKIN,Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .
ANAKIN,I'm sure you're mistaken.
ANAKIN,I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.
ANAKIN,"Yes, Master."
YODA,To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.
ANAKIN,"Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous."
ANAKIN,I should be there with him.
ANAKIN,I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.
ANAKIN,How do you know the ways of the Force?
ANAKIN,You know the dark side?!?
ANAKIN,I won't be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.
ANAKIN,What did you say?
ANAKIN,You're a Sith Lord!
ANAKIN,You're wrong!
ANAKIN,I would certainly like to.
ANAKIN,I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.
ANAKIN,I will quickly discover the truth of all this.
OBI-WAN,So uncivilized . . .
ANAKIN,"Master Windu, I must talk to you."
ANAKIN,He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.
ANAKIN,Yes. The one we have been looking for.
ANAKIN,He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side.
ANAKIN,Absolutely.
ANAKIN,"Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him."
ANAKIN,"I must go, Master."
ANAKIN,"Yes, Master."
ANAKIN,"Yes, Master."
PADME,"I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know."
C-3PO,"My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right?"
ANAKIN,I can't do this ... I can't let her die.
ANAKIN,"You can't kill him, Master. He must stand trial."
ANAKIN,It is not the Jedi way . . .
ANAKIN,(continuing) He must live . . .
ANAKIN,I need him . . .
ANAKIN,What have I done?
ANAKIN,I will do whatever you ask.
ANAKIN,Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her. I won't let her die. I want the power to stop death.
ANAKIN,I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.
ANAKIN,Thank you. my Master.
ANAKIN,I agree. The Jedi's next move will be against the Senate.
ANAKIN,"I understand, Master."
ANAKIN,What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?
OBI-WAN,"Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher levels."
OBI-WAN,"Thank you, Cody, (smiling) Now let's get a move on. We've got a battle to win here."
C-3PO,"The Chancellor's office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi Temple. Don't worry, My Lady. I am sure he will be all right."
YODA,"Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me."
YODA,"(continuing) Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . ."
YODA,"Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have."
OBI-WAN,Emergency Code Nine Thirteen ... I have no contact on any frequency. Are there any Jedi out there? . . . anywhere . . .
OBI-WAN,(continuing) I've locked on. Repeat.
OBI-WAN,Senator Organa! My Clone Troops turned on me ... I need help.
C-3PO,"My Lady, there's a Jedi fighter docking on the veranda."
THREEPIO,Hush! Not so loud!
PADME,Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here.
ANAKIN,I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.
PADME,"Captain Typho's here, we're safe. What's happening?"
C-3PO,What is going on?
C-3PO,(continuing) You can't be anymore confused than I am.
ANAKIN,The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . .
PADME,I can't believe that!
ANAKIN,"I couldn't either at first, but it's true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself."
C-3PO,Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids.
C-3PO,(continuing) Shhhhhh . . . not so loud.
C-3PO,"(continuing) Whatever it is, we'll be the last to know."
PADME,"Anakin, what are you going to do?"
ANAKIN,I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you.
PADME,What about Obi-Wan?
ANAKIN,I don't know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the Chancellor.
PADME,How could this have happened?
ANAKIN,"The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate."
PADME,What are you saying?
ANAKIN,You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.
PADME,What if they start an inquisition? I've opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect?
ANAKIN,That won't happen. I won't let it.
PADME,"Oh, Anakin, I'm afraid."
ANAKIN,"Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise."
ANAKIN,"(continuing) Please, wait for me."
PADME,I will.
C-3PO,"(to Artoo) Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo."
C-3PO,"(continuing) Take care, my little friend."
C-3PO,"(continuing) My Lady, is there anything I might do?"
PADME,"No thank you, Threepio."
PADME,No.
C-3PO,I feel so helpless.
YODA,"Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is."
OBI-WAN,"You were attacked by your Clones, also?"
YODA,"With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did."
OBI-WAN,How many other Jedi managed to survive?
YODA,"Heard from no one, have we."
OBI-WAN,Have we had any contact from the Temple?
YODA,"Received a coded retreat message, we have."
OBI-WAN,"Well, then we must go back! If there are other stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed."
YODA,"Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?"
OBI-WAN,"Yes, Master. There is too much at stake here, and we need a clearer picture of what has happened."
YODA,I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way.
OBI-WAN,"No, I don't think so. The Chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact."
YODA,"If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be."
OBI-WAN,It would be better if we stayed with the Senator.
ANAKIN,Artoo . . . stay with the ship.
OBI-WAN,There are several battalions of Clone Troopers on every level. Many are dressed as Jedi.
YODA,"Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon discovered will be."
PADME,"The Chancellor has been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi, to overthrow the Senate."
PADME,He's been presenting evidence all afternoon.
OBI-WAN,Not even the younglings survived.
YODA,"Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was."
OBI-WAN,. . .Who?? Who could have done this?
PADME,"Well, this is the moment we discover if he intends to return the Republic to a democracy."
PADME,"So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause . . ."
PADME,Not now! There will be a time.
OBI-WAN,I've recalibrated the code warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.
YODA,"Good . . . For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry."
OBI-WAN,"Wait, Master. There is something I must know . . ."
YODA,"If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find."
OBI-WAN,"I must know the truth, Master."
OBI-WAN,(continuing) It can't be . . . It can't be . . .
ANAKIN,"The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious."
ANAKIN,"Yes, My Master."
OBI-WAN,I can't watch any more.
YODA,"Destroy the Sith, we must."
OBI-WAN,Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not kill Anakin.
YODA,"To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not."
OBI-WAN,He is like my brother ... I cannot do it.
YODA,"Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader."
OBI-WAN,How could it have come to this?
YODA,"To question, no time there is."
OBI-WAN,I do not know where the Emperor has sent him. I don't know where to look.
YODA,"Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you."
OBI-WAN,"May the Force be with you, Master Yoda."
C-3PO,"Hello, might I help you . . . Oh, it's you, Master Kenobi. Come in, quickly."
OBI-WAN,Has Anakin been here . . . ?
C-3PO,Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple.
PADME,Master Kenobi . . .
PADME,"(continuing) Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you're alive."
OBI-WAN,The Republic has fallen. Padme . . . The Jedi Order is no more . . .
PADME,"I know, it's hard to believe everything to which we've dedicated our lives is gone."
OBI-WAN,I believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the making.
PADME,"The Senate is still intact, there is some hope."
OBI-WAN,No. Padme . . . It's over . . . The Sith now rule the galaxy as they did before the Republic.
PADME,The Sith!?!
OBI-WAN,I'm here looking for Anakin . . . When was the last time you saw him?
PADME,Yesterday.
OBI-WAN,And do you know where he is now?
PADME,(looks down) No.
OBI-WAN,"Padme, I need your help. He's in grave danger."
PADME,From the Sith?
OBI-WAN,"From himself . . . Padme, Anakin has turned to the dark side."
PADME,You're wrong! How could you even say that?
OBI-WAN,I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.
PADME,Not Anakin! He couldn't!
OBI-WAN,"He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the Chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith Lord we've been looking for. After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice."
PADME,I don't believe you ... I can't.
OBI-WAN,"Padme, I must find him."
PADME,"You're going to kill him, aren't you?"
OBI-WAN,He has become a very great threat.
PADME,I can't . . .
OBI-WAN,"Anakin is the father, isn't he?"
OBI-WAN,(continuing) I'm so sorry.
PADME,"There is no danger. The fighting is over, and . . . this is personal."
PADME,"I'll be all right, Captain."
PADME,"(continuing) This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me."
C-3PO,"Oh, dear."
C-3PO,Green light. Do you know that I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business.
ANAKIN,"Padme, I saw your ship . . ."
PADME,"Oh, Anakin!"
ANAKIN,"It's all right, you're safe now. What are you doing out here?"
PADME,I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.
ANAKIN,What things?
PADME,He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings.
ANAKIN,Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.
PADME,He cares about us.
ANAKIN,Us??!
PADME,He knows . . . He wants to help you.
ANAKIN,Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can't ... he can't help you. He's not strong enough.
PADME,"Anakin, all I want is your love."
ANAKIN,"Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that."
PADME,At what cost? You are a good person. Don't do this.
ANAKIN,I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you.
PADME,Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.
ANAKIN,"Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be."
PADME,I don't believe what I'm hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.
ANAKIN,I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me.
PADME,"I don't know you anymore. Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I"
ANAKIN,Because of Obi-Wan?
PADME,"Because of what you've done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you."
ANAKIN,(seeing Obi-Wan) Liar!
PADME,No!
ANAKIN,You're with him. You've betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me!
PADME,NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ...
OBI-WAN,"Let her go, Anakin."
ANAKIN,What have you and she been up to?
OBI-WAN,Let her go!
ANAKIN,You turned her against me.
OBI-WAN,You have done that yourself.
ANAKIN,You will not take her from me.
OBI-WAN,Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.
OBI-WAN,(continuing) You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now . . . until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
ANAKIN,"Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire."
OBI-WAN,Your new Empire?
ANAKIN,Don't make me kill you.
OBI-WAN,"Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic ... to democracy."
ANAKIN,"If you're not with me, you're my enemy."
OBI-WAN,Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.
ANAKIN,You will try.
YODA,"I hear a new apprentice, you have. Emperor, or should I call you Darth Sidious."
YODA,Surprised?
C-3PO,What are you doing? You're going to hurt her. Wait!!
YODA,"Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious."
YODA,"(continuing) At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say."
YODA,"(continuing) If so powerful you are, why leave??"
YODA,"Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force."
ANAKIN,"Don't make me destroy you, Master. You're no match for the dark side."
OBI-WAN,"I've heard that before, Anakin . . . but I never thought I'd hear it from you."
OBI-WAN,(continuing) The flaw of power is arrogance.
ANAKIN,You hesitate . . . the flaw of compassion.
YODA,"Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi, your apprentice will destroy."
YODA,Hurry. Careful timing we will need.
YODA,"Into exile I must go. Failed, I have."
C-3PO,"I am being careful. I've got a good hold on her, but . . . I'm worried about my back. I hope it's able to hold up under this weight."
OBI-WAN,"I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able to teach you to think."
ANAKIN,I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .
OBI-WAN,"From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil."
ANAKIN,"From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil."
OBI-WAN,"Well, then you are lost!"
ANAKIN,"This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise."
OBI-WAN,"It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground."
ANAKIN,You underestimate my power!
OBI-WAN,Don't try it.
OBI-WAN,"(continuing) . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness."
ANAKIN,I hate you!
OBI-WAN,"You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you."
C-3PO,"Master Kenobi! We have Miss Padme on board. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place."
PADME,Obi-Wan? Is Anakin all right?
YODA,"Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is ..."
YODA,Eternal consciousness.
YODA,". . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is."
YODA,"A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become."
OBI-WAN,She's dying?
YODA,"Save them, we must. They are our last hope."
C-3PO,"It s some kind of reproductive process, I think."
OBI-WAN,"Don't give up, Padme."
PADME,Luke . . .
PADME,. . . Leia.
OBI-WAN,"You have twins, Padme They need you . . . hang on."
PADME,I can't . . .
OBI-WAN,Save your energy.
PADME,Obi-Wan . . . there . . . is good in him. I know there is ... still . . .
YODA,"Pregnant, she must still appear. Hidden, safe, the children must be kept."
OBI-WAN,We must take them somewhere the Sith will not sense their presence.
YODA,"Split up, they should be."
OBI-WAN,And what of the boy?
YODA,"To Tatooine. To his family, send him."
OBI-WAN,"I will take the child and watch over him. Master Yoda, do you think Anakin's twins will be able to defeat Darth Sidious?"
YODA,"Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will."
YODA,"(continuing) Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you."
OBI-WAN,Training??
YODA,An old friend has learned the path to immortality.
OBI-WAN,Who?
YODA,"One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn."
OBI-WAN,"Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish this?"
YODA,"The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you."
OBI-WAN,I will be able to talk with him?
YODA,"How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps."
C-3PO,"Oh, no."
