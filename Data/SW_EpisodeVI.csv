character,dialogue
VADER,"You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule."
VADER,Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
VADER,The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
VADER,Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
VADER,"That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress."
VADER,"I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am."
THREEPIO,"Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place."
THREEPIO,"Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, You'd probably short-circuit."
THREEPIO,"Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose."
THREEPIO,There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke.
THREEPIO,Goodness gracious me!
THREEPIO,Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.
THREEPIO,"I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go."
THREEPIO,"Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this."
THREEPIO,"Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!"
THREEPIO,"Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no."
THREEPIO,"Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt."
THREEPIO,"... and a gift.  Gift, what gift?"
THREEPIO,He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.
THREEPIO,I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things.
THREEPIO,"Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this."
THREEPIO,Good morning.
JABBA,Bo Shuda!
THREEPIO,"The message, Artoo, the message."
THREEPIO,What did he say?
THREEPIO,"This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message."
JABBA,There will be no bargain.
THREEPIO,We're doomed.
JABBA,I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is.
THREEPIO,"Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite."
THREEPIO,What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!
THREEPIO,"I am See-Threepio, human-cy..."
THREEPIO,"Oh. Well, yes."
THREEPIO,"I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily..."
THREEPIO,Disintegrated?
THREEPIO,"Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!"
JABBA,Da Eitha!
JABBA,Boscka!
THREEPIO,"Oh, no! Chewbacca!"
JABBA,At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.
THREEPIO,"Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!"
THREEPIO,Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty- five thousand.
THREEPIO,"Uh, oh... but what, what did I say?  Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand."
THREEPIO,Because he's holding a thermal detonator.
JABBA,This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.
THREEPIO,Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.
THREEPIO,He agrees!
HAN,I can't see.
HAN,Where am I?
HAN,Who are you?
LEIA,Someone who loves you.
HAN,Leia!
LEIA,I gotta get you out of here.
HAN,What's that? I know that laugh.
HAN,"Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault."
JABBA,"It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder."
HAN,Look...
JABBA,Take him away!
HAN,Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!
JABBA,Bring her to me.
LEIA,We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...
JABBA,I'm sure.
LEIA,Ugh!
THREEPIO,"Ohhh, I can't bear to watch."
HAN,"Chewie? Chewie, is that you?"
HAN,Ah! Chew--Chewie!
HAN,"Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?"
HAN,"Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody."
HAN,"A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur."
HAN,"I'm all right, pal. I'm all right."
THREEPIO,At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.
JABBA,I told you not to admit him.
JABBA,You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.
JABBA,"Your mind powers will not work on me, boy."
THREEPIO,"Master Luke, you're standing on..."
JABBA,"There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die."
JABBA,Bascka!
THREEPIO,"Oh, no! The Rancor!"
JABBA,Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.
HAN,Luke!
HAN,"Fine. Together again, huh?"
HAN,How are we doing?
HAN,"That bad, huh? Where's Leia?"
LEIA,I'm here.
THREEPIO,"Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately."
HAN,"Good, I hate long waits."
THREEPIO,"You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc."
HAN,Doesn't sound so bad.
THREEPIO,"In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years."
HAN,"On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?"
HAN,"I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur."
HAN,"You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient."
HAN,Oh... great!
JABBA,Soon you will learn to appreciate me.
THREEPIO,"Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?"
THREEPIO,"Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!"
THREEPIO,Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.
THREEPIO,"Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas."
HAN,"Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right?"
JABBA,Move him into position.
JABBA,Put him in.
HAN,"Chewie, you okay? Where is he?"
HAN,"I'm okay, pal."
HAN,Lando!
HAN,Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
HAN,"Lando, grab it!"
HAN,I'm trying!
HAN,"Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping."
HAN,Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!
HAN,Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!
HAN,"Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie."
HAN,"Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando."
HAN,It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
HAN,"Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!"
LEIA,Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.
THREEPIO,"Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!"
THREEPIO,"Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump."
HAN,I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
LEIA,That's all any of us can see.
HAN,Then I guess I'm getting better.
HAN,"I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there."
HAN,"No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing!"
HAN,Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
HAN,"Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando."
LEIA,He means \You're welcome.\
LEIA,Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.
HAN,"Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one."
VADER,The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
VADER,"Yes, my Master."
VADER,As you wish.
YODA,Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?
YODA,"I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak.  When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?"
YODA,"Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have."
YODA,Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things ... the way of the Force.
YODA,No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
YODA,"Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will."
YODA,Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.
YODA,Your father he is.
YODA,"Told you, did he?"
YODA,"Unexpected this is, and unfortunate.."
YODA,No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.
YODA,"Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny."
YODA,"Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I , the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke...  There is... another...Sky...Sky...walker."
BEN,Yoda will always be with you.
BEN,"You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view."
BEN,"Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view."
BEN,"I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault."
BEN,Anakin was a good friend.
BEN,"When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him.  I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi.  I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda.  I was wrong.  My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy."
BEN,I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
BEN,You cannot escape your destiny.
BEN,"Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke...but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience.  Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared."
BEN,"And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear."
BEN,"To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!"
BEN,Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
BEN,The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
BEN,"Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous."
BEN,"Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor."
BEN,"When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan."
BEN,"The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate."
BEN,"She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke ... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!"
HAN,"Well, look at you, a general, huh?"
HAN,"Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack."
HAN,"Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?"
HAN,Good luck.
HAN,You're gonna need it.
THREEPIO,Sounds dangerous.
LEIA,I wonder who they found to pull that off.
HAN,"Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle."
HAN,"Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you."
HAN,That's one.
LEIA,"Uh, General... count me in."
LEIA,What is it?
HAN,Luke.
THREEPIO,\Exciting\ is hardly the word I would use.
HAN,Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
HAN,Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.
HAN,"You, too."
HAN,You got her warmed?
HAN,"No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie."
LEIA,"Hey, are you awake?"
HAN,"Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again."
LEIA,"Come on, General, let's move."
HAN,"Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?"
THREEPIO,Here we go again.
HAN,"All right, hang on."
VADER,"What is thy bidding, my Master?"
VADER,What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
VADER,"Yes, my Master."
HAN,"If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie."
HAN,Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.
HAN,Transmission commencing.
LEIA,Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
HAN,It'll work. It'll work.
HAN,"Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance."
HAN,I don't know.  Fly casual.
HAN,"It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here."
VADER,Where is that shuttle going?
VADER,Do they have a code clearance?
VADER,No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.
HAN,"They're not goin' for it, Chewie."
HAN,Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.
THREEPIO,"Oh, I told you it was dangerous here."
LEIA,Shall we try and go around?
HAN,It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
HAN,Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
HAN,Hey... it's me.
LEIA,Over there! Two more of them!
HAN,"Hey, wait! Ahhh!"
THREEPIO,"Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!"
HAN,Luke! Where's Leia?
HAN,I thought she was with you.
HAN,Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
THREEPIO,"Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do."
THREEPIO,And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!
LEIA,Cut it out!
LEIA,I'm not gonna hurt you.
LEIA,"Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here is."
LEIA,"Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down."
LEIA,I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.
LEIA,All right. You want something to eat?
LEIA,That's right. Come on. Hmmm?
LEIA,"Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you?"
LEIA,What is it?
LEIA,"Come on, let's get outta here."
VADER,"The Emperor will see me, now!"
VADER,A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
VADER,My son is with them.
VADER,"I have felt him, my Master."
VADER,"They are clear, my Master."
VADER,He will come to me?
VADER,As you wish.
HAN,Luke! Luke!
THREEPIO,"Oh, Master Luke."
THREEPIO,I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.
HAN,I hope she's alright.
HAN,"What, Chewie? What? Chewie!"
HAN,"Hey, I don't get it."
HAN,"Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie."
HAN,"Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach."
HAN,"Yeah, sure."
THREEPIO,"Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!!"
HAN,Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else.
HAN,Hey!
THREEPIO,"Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!"
THREEPIO,"Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication."
HAN,What are you telling them?
THREEPIO,"Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god."
HAN,"Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?"
THREEPIO,"I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper."
HAN,Proper?!
THREEPIO,It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
HAN,"Why, you--"
HAN,My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.
HAN,I have a really bad feeling about this.
HAN,What did he say?
THREEPIO,"I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor."
LEIA,Oh!
THREEPIO,Your Royal Highness.
LEIA,"But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free."
HAN,"Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much."
THREEPIO,"But Master Luke, what magic? couldn't possibly --"
THREEPIO,"You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just..."
THREEPIO,"... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh!"
THREEPIO,"Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!"
THREEPIO,"Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness."
THREEPIO,I...I never knew I had it in me.
THREEPIO,"Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that."
HAN,What's going on?
LEIA,I don't know.
THREEPIO,Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.
HAN,Just what I always wanted.
HAN,"Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie.  Thank you. Okay."
THREEPIO,He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.
HAN,"Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back."
HAN,"And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day."
LEIA,Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
LEIA,"Just...images, really. Feelings."
LEIA,"She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?"
LEIA,"Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?"
LEIA,How do you know?
LEIA,Why?
LEIA,Your father?
LEIA,"Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have."
LEIA,I know. Somehow...I've always known.
LEIA,"No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you."
LEIA,"But, why must you confront him?"
HAN,"Hey, what's goin' on?"
LEIA,Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.
HAN,"Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?"
LEIA,I...I can't tell you.
HAN,Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?
LEIA,I...
HAN,Ahhh...
HAN,I'm sorry.
LEIA,Hold me.
VADER,"Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me."
VADER,The Emperor has been expecting you.
VADER,"So, you have accepted the truth."
VADER,That name no longer has any meaning for me.
VADER,I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.
VADER,"Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen."
VADER,Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
VADER,You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
VADER,If that is your destiny.
VADER,"It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now."
LEIA,The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
HAN,"Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this."
LEIA,What's he saying?
THREEPIO,He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
HAN,"Back door, huh? Good idea."
HAN,It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.
LEIA,"Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm."
HAN,Then we'll do it real quiet-like.
THREEPIO,"Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!"
LEIA,Quiet.
THREEPIO,I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
LEIA,"Oh, no."
HAN,There goes our surprise attack.
HAN,Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this.
THREEPIO,I have decided that we shall stay here.
VADER,His lightsaber.
VADER,"It is pointless to resist, my son."
HAN,"All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie."
LEIA,Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
HAN,"Charges!  Come on, come on!"
THREEPIO,"Oh, my! They'll be captured!"
THREEPIO,"Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me."
THREEPIO,"Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?"
THREEPIO,"Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?"
THREEPIO,We surrender.
THREEPIO,"Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo."
LEIA,The code's changed. We need Artoo!
HAN,Here's the terminal.
LEIA,"Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away."
THREEPIO,"Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!"
THREEPIO,We're coming!
HAN,Come on! Come on!
THREEPIO,"Oh, Artoo, hurry!"
THREEPIO,"My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?"
HAN,"Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing."
LEIA,I'll cover you.
HAN,I think I got it. I got it!
THREEPIO,"Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?"
HAN,Let's see.
LEIA,It's not bad.
THREEPIO,"Oh, dear."
HAN,I love you.
LEIA,I know.
HAN,Stay back.
HAN,"Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea."
VADER,Obi-Wan has taught you well.
VADER,You are unwise to lower your defenses.
VADER,There is no conflict.
VADER,"You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny."
HAN,Throw me another charge.
VADER,"You cannot hide forever, Luke."
VADER,"Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for..."
VADER,"Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will."
HAN,Move! Move!
VADER,"Luke, help me take this mask off."
VADER,Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes.
ANAKIN,"Now...go, my son. Leave me."
ANAKIN,"You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right."
HAN,Lando...
THREEPIO,They did it!
